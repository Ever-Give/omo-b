Katy Perry has a secret she is going to reveal during her concert. she is going to debut a new song that may sound like one of her hits but she has changed the words. she tells the story of how before she made it big and had a huge tour bus she had to go to gigs in her car. one day driving to her show she had to pee, but there was lots of traffic, and she said i ended up peeing my pants stuck in traffic, but to my surprise i was turned on and liked it, thats why i took my song i kissed a girl and changed it to i peed my pants. she starts singing, one day while stuck in traffic i had to go pee but couldnt hold it, I peed my pants and I liked it I hope my fans dont mind it, and as she was singing she was peeing herself right on stage, see im doing it right now and i like it. to katys surprise she noticed some fans in the front row starting to do the same. so starting the next night a lucky select group of fans were invited on stage to pee their pants with Katy.
