Chapter 3

Isabel Luna got off the car that had driven her back home. She was standing in front of the door, hurriedly looking for the key that opened her door. As it opened, she walked through her lavish garden, three cats resting in it, into her kitchen and to the one place that was key in the daily ritual of any working woman who had just gotten home after work.

Her sink was made of marble and had plenty of hygiene and skincare products next to it. Her shower was a glass cylinder that rose all the way to the roof, next to her jacuzzi. But her focus was currently on her grayish green square-shaped porcelain throne. Isabel’s hands went to the zipper on the back of her pencil skirt, keen to undo it. As she fought her way out of the tight skirt that had been squeezing her bladder for the past few hours, it eventually fell to her ankles, revealing her butt, clad by a pair of cheeky, flower laced meshy white panties that were covered by a skin-toned pantyhose. Her hands went to her waistband, pulling her panties and pantyhose to her ankles in one sweep. Isabel, now free from her haute couture restraints, let her ample rear end fall to the toilet seat, relaxed and let the stress of the day flow out of her, a loud sigh leaving her lips.

*PSHPSHPSHHHHHHHHH*

“Ahh, finally…”

This had been an especially rough day on her bladder,. The preparations for the press meeting, along with the interviewers, had kept her busy for the past few hours in such a way that a restroom wasn’t available at any point. Moreover, the local beer producers requested a toast with her. She had to drink enough to not appear rude, but not too much to where her body wouldn’t make it through the ride home. Not to mention the fact that she couldn’t let her need be evident. Crotch grabbing, fidgeting and the sort would be fatal to her reputation as a strong, powerful politician who always had things under control. If she had skipped one toilet break too many or had more coffee than she should back at her office, those were things that could only be known by the walls of her restroom.

A bladder strengthened by years of long business meetings and withholding breaks for the sake of protocol and etiquette was not unfamiliar with these circumstances. Isabel had always been able to ride the waves all the way home. Her bodily needs would not stop her ambition. But she still always appreciated being able to lean back and piss it all away after a long day. Legs wide open, a strong stream coming from between them, clashing against the water below, in the privacy that only a restroom could provide. As much as she wished to ignore it, she was still a regular human.

As Isabel felt the last of her bladder’s contents coming out, she reached for a large amount of toilet paper and wiped herself dry. She pulled her underwear and pantyhose back up, hurled her skirt at her bed, her falling face down on it soon afterwards, her high heels slid off her feet and fell to the marble floor below them, making a clacking noise.

“Ugh, fucking press people and their dumbass questions…”

She had a conflicted relationship with press conferences. The announcers always introducing her as “The gorgeous Senator Luna” and all the interviewers with their tone-deaf innuendos, thinking they are cleverer than they are. All of them trying to diminish her, to make her subservient to whatever the current agenda was. All of them trying to take control of her.

She needed them to raise herself up, but goddamnit could she use better steppingstones. At least ones that weren’t as annoying. But these were things that she had come to terms with as a necessary evil. She could deal with the ugly old men treating her as a know-it-all, the nosy interviewers asking questions only to virtue signal, and the paparazzi always taking photos of her thighs whenever she got off her car. She could take it. It was a necessary evil to achieve her goals.

The young prodigy that had created a nationwide economic boom had to become a reality. Booze Fiesta had to become a reality. She would no longer have to suck up to others, she would finally be able to hold the reins of her life. And who knows what could come afterwards? Her own political party? Presidency? World domination? The sky would be the limit at that point.

“Fuck, I haven’t washed off my make up…”

Are you going to write more for your golden shakedown story or not?

Eventually I hope to, it's just easier to write for this since I don't have to think of gambles for the characters to play. A chapter of Golden Shakedown is trickier.

Chapter 4

Alba Allegra had her trembling legs tightly crossed below the news deck, pressing them to compensate for the fact that her hands had to stay in frame. A bead of sweat that she was hoping wouldn’t show up on camera was running down her forehead. As her tight red dress squeezed her swollen abdomen, she ran a hand through her shoulder length brown hair in order to try to cope with the pulsing sensation assailing her without being too obvious. Fully tense, she was eagerly waiting for the sports section to be over.

“And that’s all for today! We’ll see you tomorrow with the most groundbreaking news from all around the world. See you soon!”

As soon as the cameras went off, Alba’s scant façade of TV- savvy composure quickly fell apart, hunching over for a second to try and regain enough control over herself. She bolted off her seat and out of the TV set. Moving through the hallways as fast as her black heels would allow, she ignored anyone who tried to talk to her. She couldn’t pay attention to anything other than keeping her hands between her legs, desperately trying to keep the liquid mass inside her from soiling the reputation that she had fought so hard to get.

After a hellish gauntlet through the studio, she finally made it to her dressing room. Over the past few weeks, whenever she wanted to use one of the regular restrooms, they were usually full of interns who were far more hydrated than they should. Alba would not have been able to endure waiting in line if there was one. She had to trust her dressing room toilet, always a reliable oasis.

As soon as she entered her dressing room, she quickly closed the door and went into her bathroom, opening the door with one hand and lifting her dress up to her waist with the other. Alba quickly yanked her pantyhose and lacy pink panties down along her thighs and to her knees. As this was happening, she let her butt fall onto the toilet seat, a warm jet of liquid forcing itself out of her as soon as she felt its cold touch.

HISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS

“Ahhhhhh, thank goddddddddddd…i needed this so bad...”

Alba had a business lunch with some TV executives a few hours prior to her being on air. She had drunk wine and water carelessly, thinking that she could have a toilet break prior to going to the studio. She wasn’t expecting the gargantuan toilet line, composed of many ladies bursting full of booze hoping for a chance to keep themselves dry. Alba tried waiting, but eventually it became apparent to her that she wouldn’t be on time for the show if she didn’t leave soon.

Owing to the hellish traffic, she was barely able to make it to the studio on time for makeup, having no time to take a toilet break. She had to nurse all the drinks that she had throughout the meal for the hour that the broadcast lasted, which led to the fierce release that was currently taking place.

“Damn…one of these days I’m not gonna make it…”

She had been able to stay in control of her bladder through the whole day, finally letting all of it leave her after getting the privacy she so desperately wanted. Shivering and in bliss, with her stream slowing down, Alba relaxed her whole body, letting the remainder of her bladder dribble out of her. She then took out her phone, and began browsing her socials; annoyance taking the place of the urgency that had just gushed out of her.

“Ugh, what is up with toilet lines? They are getting worse and worse! Is someone trying to make everyone pee themselves? I just want to be able to drink in peace without having to worry about leaking on live TV…”

As she kept scrolling on her phone, Alba saw a video that caught her attention.

“Gigi Gali…Toilet Awareness Movement…This is new…”

As she began to wipe herself, Alba couldn't help but see a small leak on the gusset of her panties, the sight of which made her face redden slightly. She felt as if her dignity was being mocked by the world.

“…Maybe it’s time for the interviewers to be the interviewees…”
