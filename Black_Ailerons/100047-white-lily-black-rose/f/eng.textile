Hello everyone!

Well… It’s time to bite the bullet and post something, I guess. I’ve been a fan of this forum many years—ever since I figured out what this fetish was called, really—and I’ve had this idea floating around for a while. I’ve been working on it on and off for some time (about three years), and I’m finally ready to start posting it.

This story begins in September, 1941. In a surprise move, Germany has declared war on the Soviet Union, and their troops have pushed eastwards at an alarming pace. Soviet losses are catastrophic. In order to compensate for wavering manpower, Soviet women are stepping into an increasingly large role in the war effort. They see front-line action not only on the ground, but in the sky as well: hundreds of Soviet women serve heroically on the front lines as fighter and bomber pilots.

As the Third Reich bears down hard, the Soviet Union seeks to shelter what remains of the Red Air Force by relocating their bases to hidden locations behind the front lines. In the remote Russian north, a newly formed squadron of six female pilots has been deployed to one such hideout, dubbed bukhta (cove).

This is my first omorashi-themed story (and, for that matter, the first story I’ve ever written that was longer than a few pages). I hope you enjoy! o7

One other note – I started writing this before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. I hope nobody misinterprets this story as support in any form for the modern-day Russian government.

//// September 1, 1941

It was the first day of autumn. The long, hot days of a northern summer were quickly shortening, and the rains had started to roll in. The dirt roads that were the only way through the Russian forest had turned to mud, forcing the convoy to slash brown furrows through the terrain. The evergreens were laden with moisture; every branch and needle sparked with water in the wan sunlight. There was a feeling of timelessness in the air, as if the entire forest and everything in it would never move again. The war, and the tumult that it brought, seemed worlds away.

Lilya watched through her window-slit as the column of trucks wove its way north. There was no seating of any kind in her transport, so she sat with her back against the cold metal wall, her white-blonde hair draped across her face as she looked at the passing trees out of the corner of her eye. The three other girls in the vehicle were asleep, wrapped in blankets on the vehicle’s metal floor. Surrounded by these sleeping strangers, and already farther from home than she’d ever been, Lilya felt terribly alone. Even so, she dreaded the moment the journey would come to an end. She—Lilya Litvyak, a farm-girl of eighteen years—was going to war. A year ago, it would have been beyond belief. But that was before Germany had betrayed the Soviet Union and stormed the western border.

In the early days, the war had seemed wonderfully exciting. Despite the disaster of the opening months, morale had remained high on the home front, and Lilya had felt certain that the Wehrmacht would be repulsed. Back in her hometown, patriotic music played every day, and she had lamented that the men were allowed to march out and fight while the women had to stay behind. Her brother had been conscripted in the very first week, leaving her alone with her mother. Lilya had been flying civilian aircraft for years—crop-dusters, mainly—and expected to be saddled with cargo- or transfer-flight duties. 

When the letter had arrived in the mail calling her into frontline service, it had felt like a dream come true. She had imagined crowds cheering as she stood in the center of Red Square, medals flashing on her chest, Yakovlevs roaring overhead in tribute. The war would be a grand adventure; a chance for her to bring honor to her family and her country. She hadn’t felt scared until the convoy had arrived pick her up.

A few men from the village had stumbled out: broken men, with bloodstained bandages and dead eyes. She could still feel their eyes staring through her; still imagine the horrors that they had seen. As she shuffled past the wounded soldiers—alone, gripping her small roll of belongings—she was forced to cast aside her fantasies and acknowledge that in a few months’ time, she would probably be dead.

The truck lurched, bringing her back to the present. A heap of blankets moved as the girl next to her poked out her head. Her blonde hair tumbled past her shoulders as she looked around. Her gaze quickly settled on Lilya. “Oh, hello! I’m sorry; if I had known you were awake, I wouldn’t have left you all alone! You must have been bored out of your mind just staring at trees for fifty fucking hours.” The girl’s face was beautiful, with bright blue eyes, smooth white skin and a mouth that looked made for smiling.

Lilya tried to force a smile of her own. She normally wasn’t one for small talk, but in that moment, she wanted a friend.

“Oh, it’s all right. It really is beautiful up here, away from everything. I’ve just been…thinking about things. What’s your name? I’m Lilya.”

“Natalya.” With her blankets still wrapped around her, the blonde girl sat up and scooted to the side of the car so that she was sitting next to Lilya. “Aren’t you cold? Sitting on the metal like this is torture; I’m freezing my ass off!”

Lilya tried to think of something funny to respond with, but only managed a half-smile and a shrug. “I don’t know. It’s not so bad. I guess, growing up, the farmhouse where we lived would always let in the wind. After a while you just get…” Lilya trailed off. A hundred different memories overwhelmed her, unbidden: pulling fresh-baked bread from the oven on a wooden paddle; sprinting through the neighbor’s fields with her brother with a clutch of stolen eggs in her knapsack; listening to the warmth of her mother’s voice as she told her stories before bed; lying on a hilltop, staring up at the clouds on a perfect summer’s day…

Her vision suddenly blurred, and try as she might, she could not stop tears from running down her face. Doubt overwhelmed her. She was a daughter of the Soviet Union; why was she crying at the thought of making the same sacrifices that so many already had? Some fighter she would make! She turned away from Natalya in shame.

Undeterred, Natalya slid closer and took Lilya’s hand in her own.

“Hey, listen, it’s all right. You’re not the only one who’s scared. None of us know what we’re doing here. You don’t have to pretend.”

At the unexpected warmth of her comrade’s touch, Lilya’s breath caught. She turned her head, and saw that Natalya was smiling again; not playfully this time, but kindly. For the first time since her departure, Lilya felt something like hope stir in her chest.

With a slender hand, Natalya brushed Lilya’s hair off of her face. “All we have to do is stick together.”

/****/

The hours drifted by quickly as the two girls fell deep into conversation, huddled together underneath Natalya’s blankets. Lilya was amazed at how easy it was to speak to her new companion. Bound together by shared circumstance, they felt like two childhood friends who had reunited, eager to tell each other about the intervening years. Natalya, it turned out, had been born the only daughter of a successful grain merchant in St. Petersburg. Although their family was no longer as wealthy as they had been before the Revolution, Natalya’s father still commanded enough respect and influence to allow his daughter to attend university, and eventually pursue her love of aviation. Natalya was never condescending or arrogant, but she carried the effortless confidence of someone who was used to getting their way. It struck Lilya that, had she herself had been raised under more affluent circumstances, she would have become a very different person.

The convoy rolled on and on; occasionally slowing where the roads were in bad condition, but never stopping its northward march. Lilya wondered aloud if they would ever reach their airbase, or if they would simply run out of fuel, get buried in the mud, and starve to death.

Natalya chuckled and pushed herself to her feet, taking her blankets with her. Lilya, suddenly bereft of warmth, shivered. Natalya shuffled to the front of the enclosure—stooping to avoid hitting her head on the roof—and banged on the metal wall. A second later a hatch opened, revealing a bushy beard protruding beneath a pair of eyebrows scrunched together by irritation. “Chto eto?”

“When are we getting out of this lockbox?” Natalya demanded in her most authoritative tone. “Is the plan to drive until we run out of road?”

The beard and eyebrows chuckled. “Nearly enough. But don’t sound so upset—in a month or two when the Wermacht breaks through, you’ll wish I’d driven you even further.”

The hatch slammed shut. The Lilya and Natalya fell silent, leaving nothing but the sound of rattling metal.

It was at this time that the two remaining girls began to stir beneath their blankets. The first to emerge was a brunette with tanned skin and disheveled, short-cropped hair. Once she got her bearings, she turned towards Lilya and Natalya. “We’re still going north?” Her voice was low and hard, although not hostile. Even wrapped in a homespun patchwork quilt, she had an intensity about her that made Lilya feel slightly uncomfortable.

Natalya was first to recover. “That’s right! The driver says the plan is to leave us up here to freeze solid, and then when spring comes we’ll thaw out behind enemy lines and take them by surprise.” The short-haired girl merely nodded.

“My name’s Natalya,” she pressed on. “And this is Lilya.” There was a painful pause. “And you are…?”

The girl was silent for a moment. “Esfir.” And with that, she turned towards the wall and pulled her quilt back over her head.

Natalya scowled and might have said something, but the fourth girl—who had just straightened up—shook her head. “Don’t worry about Esfir. We’ve been riding together since morning. She’s all right, really—she just doesn’t talk too much.” Her voice was soft and friendly, but with slight undertone of anxiety. “My name is Eva, by the way. It’s a pleasure to meet both of you.” 

As Lilya clasped the outreached hand—startlingly soft compared to her own—she took a moment to appraise Eva. She looked young, Lilya thought, even though she could be no more than a few months her junior and still be eligible for the draft. Her skin was a flawless white; clear and smooth, framed by straight brown hair that fell halfway down her back. Lilya could see the glint of gold around the collar of Eva’s sky-blue dress as her blankets slipped. Imagine wearing that to war… it must be the plainest clothing she owns. Lilya knew at once that Eva had not worked a day of hard labor in her life. Despite her good manners, Eva carried the tension of someone far outside their comfort zone. Lilya guessed she had lived a sheltered life. Not that anything would have prepared us for this…

At the mention of Eva’s name, Natalya’s eyes widened. “Eva Sokolova? I remember you! Your father came to our house for some business matter, and you were there with him. I couldn’t have been more than eight. After dinner, we left the table and snuck into gardens while they were still talking. I still remember your father shouting at you when we were caught!”

Eva blushed at the recollection, but she seemed genuinely pleased to meet someone she already knew. As the two began to talk animatedly, Lily had to suppress a stab of envy at being excluded. Eva, it turned out, was even higher-born than Natalya, being a distant member of the now-defunct Russian royal family. Natalya pressed her on how she could have possibly ended up here, but Eva seemed reticent and quickly changed the subject. Lilya was curious as well, but the conversation had left her behind, and she was silent. We’re all on the same side here—there’s no need to be jealous, she reminded herself as she returned to her window slit. The road was getting steadily worse, and the shadows were lengthening. The convoy continued north.

BANG. The truck barreled over a bump in the road, sending all four girls airborne for a second before crashing back down to the metal floor. Esfir cursed, and Eva released a yelp of fright. “God, we’d better get there soon!” Natalya shouted up towards the driver. “We’ve been driving all day and I’m starving!”

“Me too,” said Lilya quietly. She did not mention that there was another reason she hoped the ride was nearly over. She had been too distracted to notice until then, but her bladder was slowly filling up. When the truck had hit the bump, she had felt a sudden pang in her lower abdomen; for a second, she had feared she might let go by accident. The sensation had subsided to a slight pressure, but she knew it was only a matter of time before she was in real trouble. She surreptitiously glanced around to see how the other girls were doing. Natalya was definitely a little fidgety, although that might be nothing more than discomfort with their less-than-first-class travel arrangements. Eva looked uncomfortable as well, sitting stock-still against the wall. Esfir alone looked unfazed as she looked back at Lilya with bright blue eyes. Lilya averted her gaze.

Natalya started up the conversation again, and this time Lilya made sure to join in. To her surprise, both Eva and Natalya seemed interested in her unassuming life as a farmgirl and questioned her about it at length. “You rode cows? Is that even possible?” Eva asked, wide-eyed.

Lilya laughed. “Sure! That’s nothing. You should have seen what we did with the baling machine… we would jump in the middle of the haystack and get tied up in the bale. Then we would roll each other down the hill. It’s a miracle no-one got hurt!”

Eva sighed wistfully. “That sounds like so much fun. I feel like I wasted my whole life indoors.”

“It does,” Natalya agreed. “I was always envious of the adventures that Anton got up to.”

“Anton?” Eva asked. Lilya had to stop herself from rolling her eyes—it was obvious that Natalya was fishing for questions.

“Anton was my boyfriend, of sorts,” said Natalya with a mischievous grin. “He was a smoke-jumper—an airborne firefighter. He’s the one who turned me on to aviation. He would fly in transport planes with his team, and they would drop into Siberia just in front of wildfires that were threatening towns in the middle of nowhere. Sometimes, they would have to fend for themselves for weeks in the wilderness before they were picked back up again! He was a bit older, but so handsome. My father would never have approved of him, so we could only meet every once in a while, when I went into town. It was never going to go anywhere, of course. Still—” Natalya winked—“it was fun while it lasted.” Lilya blushed at the implication.

“What about you, Lilya?” Natalya asked with a grin. “Are you leaving anyone special behind?”

“I… no, not really. Living on the farm was always really busy, and I only went into town a few times a year. I never got the chance to meet many boys.” Well, that’s partly true, she thought. In fact, a lot of the boys back home had shown interest in her, but she had rebuffed them all. It was hard for her to describe why. One night, at the end of a long day’s work, a farmhand had pulled her close and kissed her before she could say no. She had kissed him back, just like in the stories—but on the inside, she hadn’t felt anything. “I guess I just haven’t met the right person.”

Natalya looked slightly amused, but nodded sympathetically. “There will be plenty of time for all that later on. What about you, Eva? Any princes we should know about?”

To Lilya’s surprise, Eva blushed and looked away. “I hardly think that’s any of your concern!”

“Well, all right then!” said Natalya, clearly taken aback. “I was just asking; it’s not like I’m trying to steal him! Esfir, what about you?”

Esfir, who had hardly spoken, only smirked. “I don’t talk about my personal life with strangers.”

“Jesus! What’s wrong with you people! We’re about to spend God knows how long together at the edge of the earth, there’s no need to—ahh!”

The truck had driven over another bump, and Natalya’s hand had involuntarily shot between her legs, sending her blankets flying. It was her turn to blush. “Sorry—I really have to pee.”

//// September 1, 1941 (CONTINUED)

“Me too,” said Lilya, trying to hide her gratitude that Natalya had spoken first. As silly as it was, she hadn’t wanted to be the first person to bring up her need to relieve herself. Now that her mind was focused on it, her bladder seemed to be filling at an accelerated rate, and the waistband of her pants felt tight. Surreptitiously, beneath her blankets, she reached down and unbuttoned them. “I… I hope we arrive soon. To be honest, I’m not sure how much longer I can wait.”

“Me, neither,” Natalya agreed. The blonde-haired girl still had her hand between her legs, and was bouncing her knees off each other. With her blankets gone, Lilya got her first proper look at her traveling companion. Natalya’s clothing was well-made but sensible: closely tailored trousers, and a winter coat that did not quite hide the curve of her generous breasts. She doesn’t look cold anymore, Lilya thought. In fact, Natalya seemed to be perspiring slightly as she crossed and uncrossed her legs.

Eva remained motionless, but she looked decidedly uncomfortable now. She was sitting straight as a rod against the metal wall, and her jaw was clenched.

Mustering her courage, Lilya slid forward and knocked politely on the driver’s hatch. A second later, his mustache popped into view. “Khorosho?”

“Excuse me, sir, could you please tell me how much farther we have to go?”

“Maybe 30 kilometers. Less than an hour, at the rate we’re going.”

An hour! “Is there any way we can stop before then? Just for a few minutes,” Lilya asked in desperation, hoping he would catch her meaning. The driver only scowled.

“We have a tight schedule, and I’m already behind! You lot aren’t my only responsibility—I have other stops to make after this. Don’t you know we’re at war? What is it you need, anyway?”

Lilya’s resolve wavered as her embarrassment won out over her discomfort. “It—it’s nothing. Sorry.” A grunt from the driver, and the hatch closed once more.

“An hour?!” exclaimed Eva.

“Yeah,” Lilya replied, fighting to keep her voice from shaking. “Well, less than an hour. So, who knows. Do you have to go as well?”

Eva hesitated, but then said, “I really do. I guess there’s no point in denying it.” Her cheeks turned pink with embarrassment.

The minutes wore on with agonizing slowness. It wasn’t long before Lilya was fidgeting almost as badly as Natalya, and she started to feel twinges of pain from her aching bladder. She couldn’t remember it ever being so swollen and heavy; it felt like a solid mass inside of her. I wonder how it feels to the touch? Her curiosity got the better of her. Keeping one hand firmly against her crotch, she reached the other under her shirt and gently pressed down. She whimpered as a jolt of pain surged through her, and she clenched her muscles hard to avoid losing control. Her bladder was as hard as a rock! 

With every bump in the road, she could feel her pent-up urine jostle inside her, begging for release. She felt sweat prickle on her scalp, and—no longer caring if the other girls saw her in such a desperate state—tossed her covers to the floor. Eva and Natalya were too distracted to notice, but Esfir caught her gaze and grinned. The short-haired girl seemed amused by their plight, and certainly showed no signs of needing to pee herself. Lucky bitch, Lilya thought uncharitably. She glanced outside. The sun was almost down now, and its light had taken on a golden hue.

Ten minutes to go. At most. Lilya was doing her best to keep track of time by looking at the angle of the sun, but it was an imprecise art. Meanwhile, her body was nearing its absolute limit. Her desperation seemed to be taking a new form—rather than fidgeting, Lilya found herself trying to stay as still as possible. Her bladder was absolutely bursting, and the pressure between her legs was enormous. With every bump in the road, she would squeeze her crotch as hard as she could and pray no urine leaked out, but her urethral muscles were tiring fast.

“Fuck,” she heard Natalya moan, and looked up to see her on her knees, with her ankles crossed and both hands jammed between her legs. She had discarded her coat, and her chest was heaving as she fought the urges of her body, breath by shaky breath. To Lilya’s surprise, Natalya suddenly looked up, and her green eyes met Lilya’s own. Lilya felt a sudden surge of affection brought on by their mutual agony. An odd flutter went through her stomach.

Hiss! At that moment, Lilya’s concentration faltered and she released a jet of piss. In a split second, her cotton panties were soaked through, and a wet spot blossomed on the crotch of her pants. Throwing caution to the winds, she removed her hand from outside of her pants and thrust it inside her panties, attempting to stem the flood at its source. She squeezed her throbbing muscles as hard as she could, and pressed her middle finger mercilessly against her pee-hole. She groaned with relief and frustration as the flow waned to a trickle and then stopped. For a second, it had felt so good to release the piss that was building up inside her, and her body was begging her to give in and empty her bladder. A couple drops seeped through her pants and dripped onto the metal floor. She felt her cheeks grow red with embarrassment as the truck turned, sending the drops rolling towards the other girls. “S-sorry, I couldn’t help myself,” she stammered, mortified.

Lilya’s partial accident had an immediate effect on Eva. For the last half-hour the high-born girl had maintained her composure, but the sound of Lilya wetting herself seemed to be more than she could bear. She suddenly sprung to her feet, tossing aside her blankets.

Even under the circumstances, Lilya couldn’t help but appreciate Eva’s gorgeous attire. The gold filigree Lilya had first seen on the collar of her blue dress ran all the way down to the hem, weaving intricate patterns over her slender figure. The dress ended just below the knee, and beneath, her legs were sheathed in white cotton tights. Eva’s attention, however, was fixed completely on her black leather belt, which cinched her dress at the waist. The narrow strap was biting cruelly into Eva’s abdomen, creasing her bladder as it tried to expand on either side. Lilya stared—Eva’s bladder looked even more distended than her own.

Bouncing from one foot to the other, Eva was frantically trying to undo the gold buckle, but her shaking fingers and the belt’s tightness made the task impossible. She suddenly tensed, and for just a moment Lilya heard the hiss of liquid spraying against fabric. “No… no!” Eva whimpered as she was forced to abandon her efforts with the belt. She hiked up her dress to her waist, and—like Lilya and Natalya before her—buried both hands between her legs.

Lilya gaped at Eva’s tights. Rivulets of piss were working their way down both legs, creating dark streaks in the white fabric that had nearly reached her knees. She must have been leaking for a while already, Lilya realized as she assessed the damage. The wetness was turning her tights translucent, offering just a hint of the pale skin beneath. In between Eva’s fingers, Lilya could see the darker outline of her womanhood. The fabric here was completely saturated, and a tiny trickle of urine was still escaping from between the poor girl’s nether lips and running down her fingers. Lilya stared, transfixed, as pale golden drops fell one by one off the end of a perfectly manicured fingernail. Drip……drip……drip……

“…Lilya!”

She tore her gaze away at the sound of Eva’s voice, and met her tear-filled gaze. “The belt—please—can you help me?” she begged. Her air of dignity and reserve had vanished.

For a moment, Lilya’s words failed her. “I’ll try,” she managed at last. Having released some of her urine—even just a little—Lilya felt marginally more in control. She set her jaw, dragged her hands away from her crotch, and pushed herself to her feet. As expected, the shift in position worsened her desperation, and she could feel her bladder pushing down on her urethra like a lead weight. Taking small steps, she walked over to Eva and sank to her knees in front of her.

Up close, Eva’s desperation took on a new dimension. Lilya inhaled the unmistakable scent of fresh urine, and felt the steamy warmth of the hot liquid as at radiated off of Eva’s thighs. The farmgirl could see Eva’s panties through her sopping tights, and with a mind of their own, her eyes traced the outline of the black silk over the front of Eva’s slender hips and between her legs, where they tightly cupped her—Lilya, focus! The belt!

Straightening her back, she raised her gaze and turned her attention to the gold buckle. She quickly worked out the free end of the black leather strap from the buckle frame. Then she saw the problem—to unseat the metal prong that held the strap tight, she would first have to pull it tighter! “Hold on,” she whispered to Eva. “Things are going to get worse before they get better.” Eva trembled.

Lilya grabbed the end of the belt with one hand, holding the buckle in place with the other. Well, here it goes… She gave the belt a firm tug.

Eva shrieked in pain at the sudden increase in pressure, and reflexively lifted her hands from her crotch. A geyser of piss erupted from her tortured bladder. Her soaked tights and panties were no match for the torrent, and several drops sprayed clear through, landing on Lilya’s face and chest before she could react.

Then the buckle unlatched, the belt slid off, and the geyser abated as quickly as it had started. Eva breathed out a shuddering sob of relief as her restricted bladder was finally given room to expand. She let go of her dress, and it fell back into position. “Ohhhhh… that feels so much better! Thank you so much, Lilya; I apologize for asking you to—" she broke off suddenly at the sight of a dumbstruck Lilya wiping off her face. She blushed crimson. “Oh god—did I? When—oh god, I’m so, so sorry!”

Lilya struggled for a response. “It’s okay, Eva. Honestly. I—I’m not upset with you.” The strangest thing was, it was true—she wasn’t. Her feelings were hard to put into words, but she felt almost shell-shocked. It was as if she had narrowly avoided death and was trying to laugh away the terror or the moment; a blind panic mixed with a euphoric thrill. What the hell is wrong with me? She wobbled as she pushed herself to her feet—her legs were suddenly weak.

“Thank you again,” whispered Eva, managing a tiny smile.

“You’re welcome.” Interesting choice of words, Lilya. Oh well. Turning away at last, she walked back towards her original spot on the wall. Natalya was fully preoccupied by her own discomfort, and didn’t seem to have noticed what had transpired at all. Esfir, however, was looking at Lilya intently. Her face was inscrutable. Lilya could feel her bright blue eyes following her as she walked past and returned to her seat.

To her surprise, the excitement thrumming through her body seemed to be taking the edge off her desperation. The pressure was still there, but somehow the actual urge to urinate… wasn’t? It was very strange. She cast about for a possible explanation for the way she felt. It’s simply aesthetic appreciation, she decided at last. Eva is undeniably a beautiful woman, and the drama and emotion of the whole…scene…was like a work of art. It’s evocative, that’s all. Just like a good song, or a vivid sunset. Although, if truth be told, she couldn’t remember even the prettiest sunset having quite the same effect on her…

Her musings were brought up short by the screech of the truck’s brakes. A minute later, it lurched to a halt. After being in constant motion for so long, the stillness was disorienting. Clang! The truck’s loading doors swung open. Light flooded into the enclosure, revealing their driver standing on a long strip of runway ringed by forest. Lilya could see several airplane hangars on one side, and two long buildings on the other.

“Zdravstvuyte, ladies,” said the driver. “Take your possessions, get out of the truck, and form up in front of that building. Lieutenant Katya Budanova is expecting you.”

////

The four girls stood in a line, with the sun setting over the airfield behind them. Apart from the numerous hangars, the airbase had two long, low-slung buildings, both of which looked to be barracks. One of them was a good bit larger than the other, but it was the smaller that flew the Soviet flag, the hammer and sickle snapping proudly in the wind. It was this building that the four recruits faced. Eva stood the farthest to the left; back straight, chin up, looking like a princess of a bygone age. 

The sun’s yellow rays sparked and danced across the gold on her dress. Next to her Esfir stood confidently, legs apart and hands clasped behind her back in a military pose. With the wind ruffling her short hair and the fringes of her well-worn coat, she looked every bit the soldier. Lilya did her best to emulate her, but her need to pee was steadily returning. Standing with her legs apart did not help matters; she was forced to rely solely on her aching pelvic muscles to hold her water, and she was tiring fast.

Her struggle was nothing compared to Natalya’s, though. The pretty blonde was unable to stand up straight, and both her hands were glued to her crotch. Natalya had been at her bursting point for an unbelievably long time, and was now leaking as quickly as she was filling up. Her close-fitting trousers were soaked from her waist to her thighs, and they clung wetly to the curves of her body. A trail of droplets dotted the concrete; they ran from the now-departed truck to the ground between her trembling legs, where more were steadily falling. Just give in already, Lilya wanted to say, even though she admired Natalya’s tenacity.

A strong gust swirled across the airfield, laden with the scent of pine and gasoline. The wind caught Eva’s dress, lifting the hem above her waist. Lilya caught another glimpse of her piss-soaked white tights, and—just above—the bulge of her distended bladder. Eva hurriedly pulled her dress back down. “My belt! I’d forgotten all about it!” she exclaimed. She reached into her travel bag, pulled out the black leather garment and looped it around her waist. She attempted to refasten it, but was unable to pull it tight enough.

“Are you out of your mind, Eva?” Natalya exclaimed. “Don’t you remember why you had to take it off in the first place?” Eva continued her struggle, tugging repeatedly on the belt, gasping as each contraction squeezed her bladder. “It’s almost—ahh!—on! There’s a looser setting, I’ll—ohh!—I’ll be fine.” She looked up plaintively. “Lilya, I’m so embarrassed to ask you again, but—can you help me? Please?”

Lilya hesitated. Again?! I’m not sure I’ve recovered from the first time! “I…”

“I’ll help.” Before Lilya or Eva could respond, Esfir stepped into position behind Eva, wrapping her arms around the slender girl’s waist. She took the belt from Eva’s hands. Nervousness flitted across Eva’s face.

“Esfir, please be care—ahhhh!”

Esfir pulled the belt savagely, fastening it in place. With a taut hiss, Eva’s floodgates finally broke.

A pressurized stream of urine erupted from her body, and this time Eva was powerless to stop it. She made a halfhearted attempt to stem the flow with her hand, then gave up and resigned herself to her fate. Bending forward, she moaned with relief as pee gushed down her thighs and splattered in a steaming puddle on the ground. Her face was red with humiliation, but her expression was almost blissful. Lilya could now see tracks of piss working their way down Eva’s tights past the knee. “Your shoes!” she warned.

Still pissing with full force, Eva belatedly thought of her clothing. She hiked up her dress and hooked her thumbs inside her waistband. Then she squatted down, pulling her tights and panties to her knees.

For the first time, Eva’s torrent of urine rushed out unimpeded, and Lilya saw her nakedness in the light of day. Lilya knew she shouldn’t look, but once again found her eyes glued to the spectacle in front of her. Esfir too seemed transfixed—she still hadn’t moved from her position behind Eva. Eva’s sex was completely shaven, and Lilya could clearly see the urine splashing off the dark pink of her labia beneath her swollen hood. As Lilya watched, the stream finally weakened and tapered off. The last few drops trickled down her lips and fell to join the growing puddle between her feet.

With a swish, Eva pulled up her soaked tights and stood up. “See? I got my belt on after all,” she said in a shaky voice. Then she grinned. It was not the polished smile of a noblewoman, but something wilder—an expression that was equal parts afraid and exhilarated. She had wandered into a story book: hidden in the Russian forest, one day into a suicide mission. Wetting herself was just icing on the cake. Lilya realized she had misjudged her comrade—there was more to Eva than there appeared.

A minute passed. Natalya continued to squirm and leak. Eva shivered as the urine on her legs cooled. Then, the doors to the barracks swung open, and the girls stood at attention. A solitary figure emerged.

Lieutenant Katya Budanova was a tall woman, a trait accentuated by her stiff military posture. Her shoulder-length black hair was combed straight back under a red beret. Her closely tailored tan uniform highlighted her lean, imposing physique, and from the hardness in her gaze Lilya had no doubt she knew how to use the Tokarev on her hip. Despite her strong features and high cheekbones, she looked younger than Lilya expected—she had envisioned a grizzled veteran, but the woman in front of her seemed no older than thirty. Nonetheless, her aura of command was unmistakable. She looked at the girls one by one, contemplating Esfir for a moment before turning to Lilya. Lilya met her gaze, trying not to flinch as she stared back into her commander’s dark eyes.

After an inscrutable moment, Katya turned to Natalya. The blonde-haired girl was somehow managing not to fidget, but Lilya could see the panic in her eyes. The stress of standing still with her legs apart looked agonizing, and Lilya knew she couldn’t hold out much longer. For her friend’s sake, she hoped their briefing was a short one. Lilya thought she saw the corner of her commander’s mouth curl up in the barest hint of a smile as she looked Natalya up and down. Then, at last, she focused her attention on Eva.

Her eyes flashed as she took in the aftermath of Eva’s accident. “What is the meaning of this?” she asked flatly. Her voice was low and cool, and it sent a shiver of secondhand fear through Lilya.

To her credit, Eva kept her poise, betrayed only by the flush in her cheeks. “My apologies, Lieutenant. I waited as long as I could. Our orders were to stand here until we received further instructions.”

Katya slowly nodded, and an expression that might have been approval crossed her face. “Very well. I’ve seen worse. You all will, by the time we’re done here.

“Daughters of the Soviet Union—you have arrived here at Bukhta airbase in your country’s most desperate hour of need. Even as you were traveling here today, I have received news that German forces have pushed even further east. Smolensk has been encircled by the enemy, and supply lines cut off. Without reinforcement, the troops defending the city won’t last the month.”

Lilya felt her stomach drop. Smolensk was the last major city between the front line and Moscow.

“The Soviet strategy is unchanged,” Katya continued. “Draw out the enemy, overextend him, and outnumber him at every encounter. Every step the Germans take eastwards is a step further from Berlin, and already their supply lines are under stress. Our intelligence reports that German fuel reserves are running low, and keeping up their offensive will only get harder as the cold sets in. If we can last the winter, we may yet survive.

“And that, ladies, is where we come in. This airbase is some four hundred kilometers to the northeast of Moscow, and positioned as far as possible from any other targets of strategic interest. You will not find it on any map. It is designed to be able to operate without resupply for months on end, so that no matter what fate befalls the Red Army this winter, we will still be able to take to the skies. Our mission is to disrupt the German advance in any way possible. We will attack convoys, bases, supply depots, and—if necessary—enemy aircraft. This squadron is one of the very first in the world to allow women to fly fighter aircraft in combat. To do so in defense of your homeland is an honor and a privilege.

“As I mentioned, Bukhta is isolated by design. Thus, our contact with the outside world will be kept to a minimum. We may receive the occasional resupply, but if I were you, I would not expect to go on leave for quite some time. These barracks will be your home.” Katya turned and gestured to the building behind her. This is where you all will stay. It may not be as luxurious as the accommodations some of you are used to”—she glanced at Eva—“but it is a damn sight nicer than the amenities afforded to your comrades on the front lines. Assuming the gas doesn’t run out, we will have heat and warm meals through the winter.

“The larger building behind you is for the grounds crew. There are four of them to every plane, and their work is just as important as ours, since we can’t get off the ground without them. You will get a chance to meet them—and familiarize yourself with your planes—tomorrow.

Katya paused, and her expression grew somber. “We are, all of us, alone out here. In our moments of greatest need, there will be no reinforcements to assist us. There are no reserves waiting to take our place on the front lines. We will have nobody to turn to but each other. Even if, by some miracle, we prevail, and send the Germans reeling back to Berlin, there will be no parades for us; no banquets; no medals. And, if we die, not even our families will ever know why or how. After all, we were never here.

“There is only one reward I can promise you. You have been given a rare opportunity—a chance at greatness. Many men and women have wasted their days longing for such a chance, or committed terrible deeds in search of one. And yet here we are—not because we want to be, but because our brothers and sisters across this nation demand nothing less.

“Now, go inside. Eat, rest, and get yourselves situated. I’ve forgotten to mention—there is one more member of our squadron whom you have not met. She is inside. I expect you all to treat her with the same respect you would give to each other.” A ripple of confusion moved through the girls at the unexpected warning.

“Dismissed!” Katya turned on her heel and walked away, leaving the recruits to pick up their bags. The door had barely closed behind her when Lilya heard a moan of relief and the sound of rushing liquid. Natalya, having somehow held herself together under Katya’s stern gaze, had finally broken. She didn’t even try to pull up her trousers; she simply fell to her knees and surrendered to the pressure in her bladder. A trickle of urine dripped down from her crotch, but even with her legs far apart most of her piss clung to her pants, eventually pooling at her knees. Steam curled off her legs in the frigid air. Natalya’s entire body shook with emotion. She ducked her head, hiding from the other girls behind a veil of blonde hair.

As soon as Lilya heard the sound of yet another accident, she felt her own desperation multiply. Katya’s speech had drawn her full attention, distracting her from her swollen bladder, but the sight of the second wetting of the evening dragged her back to reality. She jammed a hand in her crotch, and watched mutely as the surreal scene played out.

A minute later, Natalya’s stream finally abated, but she made no move to stand. Her head was still bowed, and Lilya heard a barely suppressed sob. It was Eva who stepped forward to console her. “Natalya, look at me,” she said in an authoritative tone. With a sniff, Natalya slowly looked up at her friend. Eva was standing in front of her with her arms crossed and her chin up. Her lower half still glistened from her accident moments before, and her dress clung wetly to her legs. Natalya’s tear-streaked face curled into a small smile. “I have to admit, you still look pretty fucking great.”

Eva grasped Natalya’s arm and helped her to her feet. “If I can wear it, so can you. Now come on, let’s help Lilya with her bags. Maybe one of us can finish this journey without wetting ourselves.”

Sorry, a shorter segment this time. I will try to keep posting at least once a week.

////

A blast of warm air greeted Lilya as she hobbled through the barracks doorway, her hands jammed between her legs. With every step, her desperation seemed to worsen; somehow, the pressure of knowing that Eva and Natalya were trying to help her to reach a toilet only made matters worse. She had a dozen thoughts bouncing around her head, but she couldn’t hold on to any of them for more than a second before the desperate signals from her bladder overrode them. Her urethra stung furiously as she ground her middle finger against it from inside her panties, and her abdominal muscles fluttered, right on the edge of giving out. I have to pee I have to pee… oh please I have to pee… She looked left and then right, frantically searching for a lavatory. Beds… dressers… doors… where was the bathroom?! Ah! I can’t focus!

Lilya was just resigning herself to pissing right there in the barracks doorway when she felt a gentle hand on her arm. A young woman she didn’t recognize stood in front of her, looking up at her with dark eyes. “Are you looking for the bathroom? It’s right down there.” She pointed to a door at the far end of the building. “T-thanks,” Lilya stammered, and with her last dregs of willpower she staggered across the room and heaved open the door.

As soon as her hand left her crotch to pull the door handle, her exhausted pelvic muscles finally surrendered. She yanked her pants down and squatted over the toilet just as urine began to spray out through her panties. The sensation of release was painful at first, but soon mellowed to a blissful relief. She closed her eyes, and bit her lip to keep from moaning at the delicious sensation flooding through her body.

Ah…. ah…. that’s so much better! She made no attempt to remove her soaked panties, instead enjoying the warmth of her urine as it spread across her sex. The sensation was completely novel. She had touched herself plenty of times before—usually while taking a bath—but she couldn’t remember her body ever being this sensitive. She could feel every thread in her cotton panties as they rubbed across her lips and against her hood. Ever so gently, she traced a fingertip up the edges of her slit, savoring the electric tingle her touch left in its wake. As she slowly emptied her throbbing bladder, she breathed deeply, feeling her stress fade and her entire body relax.

At last, her stream faded to a trickle. She opened her eyes…

…and realized she hadn’t closed the bathroom door!

////

Mortified, Lilya seized the handle and slammed the door shut, muffling the sound of Natalya’s giggling. Her heart hammered in her chest, and she felt suddenly lightheaded. They saw me! Natalya and Esfir has been staring right at her when she’d looked up, and Eva had been looking away a little too pointedly to be credible. Having grown up working outdoors, Lilya had never been particularly shy about relieving herself—you couldn’t spend your day walking to and from the outhouse, so if you were working near someone else you just squatted down behind the best cover you could find—but this was different. It wasn’t just that she had wet her panties in full view of her new friends.

They had seen her transfixed with pleasure—seen her touching herself, for god’s sake. It wasn’t like that, she tried to tell herself. Right? Her pussy throbbed. Against her will, her hand slid down between her legs again, inside her panties this time. She felt a hot, sticky wetness that certainly was not urine. Fuck. It was like that. She was undeniably, agonizingly, horny, and the needs of her body could not wait. She pressed her middle finger inside herself, clenching tightly as she thrust in and out as quickly as she could without making noise. She closed her eyes, and Eva was standing in front of her on the runway, glistening in the sunset, urine flooding down her legs. 

Her body was responding faster than it ever had before, and in less than a minute she felt the tingling in her legs and stomach that meant her moment was near. She tried to pull her hand away—somehow, she felt that to finish would be to consummate the depraved fantasies swirling in her head—but her body had a mind of its own. The scene changed, and now she was the one wetting herself, standing in front of the whole squadron while Katya looked on with an icy gaze. She pulled out her finger and turned her attention to her swollen clit, rubbing her fingers in a frantic circle.

She came hard; her jaw clenched, doubled over on the toilet as she did everything in her power to keep from crying out. Colors flashed under her closed eyelids, her ears rang, and for a moment she was afraid that she would faint. She took several deep, shaky breaths to steady herself.

Then, it was over. Embarrassment, confusion, and a deep, aching shame rushed in to fill the void left by her arousal, pulsing in unison with the lingering sensation in her lower abdomen. She wrung out her panties, cleaned herself up as best she could, and opened the bathroom door.

////

To Lilya’s relief, the other four girls had wandered away while she was in the bathroom, allowing her a few shreds of dignity as she rejoined the girls. It looked as though Natalya, Eva and Esfir had already picked beds, and were starting to unpack their possessions into the cabinets that stood next to each mattress. The other girl—whom Lilya had seen fleetingly but had been too distracted to remember clearly—was not in sight.

Lilya took a second to get her bearings. She had just walked out of one of two bathroom stalls, and to her left was an entranceway to a tile-lined room full of showerheads. The five beds were lined up parallel to each other along one side of the barracks, with cabinets in between them so that when you were laying down, the cabinets blocked your view of your neighbors. Across from the beds, in the middle of the room, was the entranceway they had walked into originally. From where Lilya stood, near the bathroom door, she could see all the way across the long narrow room to the far side of the barracks. On this far wall was a doorway that led to a small mess hall or kitchen, and it looked like there was another room further past it. Lilya guessed that was their Lieutenant’s quarters.

Natalya was the first one to notice Lilya’s return. She looked like she was trying not to smile, and Lilya braced for a remark on how long she had spent in the bathroom, but Natalya only said, “We’ve already picked out our beds! It looks like you’ll be next to me, is that okay?”

“Of course!” Lilya replied with a weak smile. Natalya had taken the middle of the five beds, which put Lilya between Esfir and Natalya on the side closer to the bathrooms and showers. Eva was situated next to Natalya on the other side, which meant the bed on the end by the mess hall belonged to—

At that moment, the fifth girl stepped out from behind her cabinet. Lilya was taken aback—she didn’t look like anyone she had ever met. She was petite, with straight jet-black hair that ran past her shoulders and light brown skin. Her features were striking, beautiful even; an angled face, smooth skin and remarkably large but narrow eyes. Lilya’s first thought was that she might be Siberian, but her skin was too dark. Truth be told, she didn’t look Russian at all. “Hello! I’m Kaede,” she said, pronouncing her name kai-day. When Lilya heard her accent, something clicked into place. Is she… Japanese? What is she doing here? Although Japan and the Soviet Union were not at war, there were still plenty of people who remembered the conflict at the turn of the century. Relationships were still distinctly unfriendly, and getting worse by the day as Japan acted on its own territorial ambitions. She hesitated as she tried to formulate a question that wouldn’t be offensive.

Kaede, however, had noticed her confusion and spoke first. “I know what you are thinking. I am from Sakhalin, which is an island north of Japan. My father is from Japan, he traveled to Sakhalin and married a Russian woman. He liked it there and decided to stay.”

“I see,” replied Lilya, although Kaede’s explanation had raised more questions than it answered. What had a Japanese man been doing in Sakhalin? The obvious answer was that he had been a soldier, deployed to support Japan’s expansion to the southern half of the island following the war. “My name’s Lilya,” she said, remembering her manners. She extended her hand, and Kaede shook it with a small smile.

“So, how did you end up here?” Lilya dared to ask.

Kaede shrugged. “I know how to fly. My father taught me. He worked for a fishing fleet. I am sovetskiy; I am Russian,” she added defiantly. Lilya raised her hands placatingly. “I believe you,” she said.

From behind Lilya, Esfir gave a contemptuous snort. Kaede stiffened but did not respond.

“I don’t know about you, but I’m worn out from the trip,” Lilya said. “Let’s get some food, and then some rest. I can’t wait to learn about what planes we’ll be flying.”

Dinner was a simple but hearty affair. Katya explained that they would all take turns preparing meals for each other, and the Lieutenant herself went first. The pelmeni she had prepared tasted heavenly after their long ride north, and Lilya’s head was buzzing pleasantly with the satisfaction of the first good meal she had eaten all day. Travel-worn but happy, the girls filed out of the mess hall and retired to bed.

“Good night, Lilya,” Natalya called from behind her dresser.

“Good night,” Lilya murmured sleepily, pleased that Natalya had thought of her.

//// September 2, 1941

Lilya awoke well-rested and thrumming with energy. She hurriedly changed into her clothes, bolted down some pancakes prepared by Esfir, and rushed outside with the other girls. Her breath caught as she saw six planes pulled out onto the airstrip, sparkling in the morning light.

The aircraft towered over her. They were far bigger and more powerful than anything she’d flown before, with stout triangular wings and six exhaust ports bristling from each side of a V12 engine. Three propellors extended from the nose, each one nearly as long as Lilya was tall. Against white-and-grey winter camouflage, the red star stood out strongly on the wings and on each side of the fuselage.

“Good morning, comrades,” called Katya as she strolled towards them, looking as immaculate as ever in her military garb. “The model of plane you see in front of you here is the Yakovlev-1, which I deem to be a competent and durable fighter. In the right hands, it should see you through any engagement on equal terms.”

“I know you all have at least some piloting experience, but I caution you that crop-dusters and biplanes will only prepare you so much for flying a fighter aircraft. These planes are twice as fast—and twice as heavy—as what you’re used to.”

The recruits spent the rest of the morning learning about the technical aspects of their planes. Each of them was tutored by their respective ground crew leads—in Lilya’s case, a cheerful, middle-aged man with a large bald spot and a large belly to match named Andrei.

“The engine has more displacement than what you’re used to,” he told her, looking up at the cowling of the Yakovlev fondly. “It will take longer to get warm, especially in the winter. You’re going to have to let it idle for several minutes to get the oil flowing. But don’t forget! The engine may be liquid-cooled, but you will overheat if you stay on the airfield too long.”

Finally, after lunch, the focus of their instruction turned from keeping the aircraft running to learning to fly them. For this portion, Katya addressed the girls directly. “The weight of these Yakovlevs means they are going to turn much slower than civilian aircraft, and will stall at higher speeds,” she said sternly. “If we can avoid crashing any of these aircraft due to preventable error, I will consider it a blessing. There are a few numbers you will have to learn by heart—the most important of which are the stall speed, and the never-exceed speed.”

On and on it went—by the time Lilya sunk into bed that night her head was buzzing with statistics and instructions. The next day was more of the same; learning not just the specifications of the Yak-1 but also those of its various German opponents. The Messerschmitt 109, she learned, was faster at any significant altitude, but couldn’t quite run down the Yak at ground level. “All the same, don’t go cruising along over the treetops,” Katya chided. “A speed advantage on the deck won’t do you any good when the Germans dive on you. Speed is your life; altitude is your insurance.”

////

“What do you think of the training so far?” Lilya asked Natalya as the two of them tucked into lunch.

“Not too bad,” Natalya replied casually. “It all feels pretty basic, to be honest. I suppose it’s important to learn about the climbing speeds of the plane or whatever, but that’s not what flying is really about, is it? You have to feel it! I can’t wait to get in the air.”

Esfir nodded in agreement. “The Yaks might have more horsepower, but a plane is still a plane. It’s nothing we can’t handle.”

Eva, however, looked frozen. She looked paler than ever, and she hadn’t touched her food. “It’s all very well for the four of you,” she said it a shaky voice. “You all know how to fly! I hadn’t even sat in a plane until a few weeks ago! It will be a miracle if I even get off the ground!”

“Eva, you’ll be fine!” Natalya said earnestly. “Honestly, flying isn’t as difficult to pick up as most people think! It’s no harder than driving a—” Lilya cut her off with a discrete shake of her head—there was no way a girl like Eva knew how to drive, either. “Well anyways, it’s really simple!” Natalya blustered on. “Once you relax a bit, you’ll love it, I know you will. And besides, we have an actual combat veteran as our instructor! You’ll have it down in no time.”

“I haven’t known you for very long,” Lilya added, “but I know that you have spirit. And I don’t know the story of how you got here, but the fact that you made it to the front lines shows that you have courage. It’s the Germans that I’m worried about.”

Eva sniffed, but smiled all the same.

That night, Kaede and Esfir retired quickly, but Eva, Natalya and Lilya were too excited to sleep. Tomorrow, they would get to fly as members of the Military Air Forces, and that thought was enough to keep them out of their beds. They sat together on the floor around an oil lamp, offering advice for Eva and sharing stories of their civilian piloting escapades. It wasn’t long before Natalya was recounting a story of a flight she had taken with Anton, her erstwhile boyfriend.

“We were about fifteen kilometers from the landing strip when the engine just died—we’d run out of fuel! I was the copilot—Anton was flying back an empty transport that had resupplied a smoke-jumper outpost, you see, and I wasn’t supposed to be there at all. We found out later looking at the plane that a fuel line had snapped, and all the gas had drained out! He somehow managed to set us down in a field without snapping off anything important. That’s harder than you think, you know… if you fuck up your entry, you’re not going to have enough energy to circle around for another pass.

“Anyways, after we landed, we got out and looked around for a bit, but the sun was starting to go down and we didn’t want to get lost after dark. We decided to spend the night in the cargo hold of the plane.” Natalya looked down for a moment, and giggled. “Well, you’ve heard me talk about Anton enough to guess what we did that night. After a landing like that, we were both far too awake to try to sleep…”

Eva looked away, embarrassed. Lilya met Natalya’s eyes and returned her grin, but she had a strange sensation in her stomach. It wasn’t quite envy, but the thought of her friend enjoying such wild pleasures made her feel oddly hollow. “What’s it like?” she asked impulsively. Eva looked up in surprise.

Natalya was quiet for a moment, and Lilya could tell that for all of her extroverted confidence she wasn’t sure how to answer. “It depends,” she said at last. “Sometimes it’s bad—like, you don’t even feel like you’re there. And what makes it good or bad isn’t just how skilled they are. It’s more complicated than that. Ah, I feel like I’m not explaining it very well!

“What makes it feel good is the connection. At least for me. Before they even touch you, you feel the attraction, you want it. And when they do touch you it’s like every inch of your body is more sensitive. And then from there it builds on itself, because you get more excited, and they can sense that, which makes them more excited. And then the world gets very small. You’re not worrying about anything, or fantasizing about anything else, it’s just you and them.”

“And then when—well you know—when you get close, you feel this tingling heat that goes through your whole body. And it’s such a rush of emotion. The only thing that comes close is flying a plane. That’s what it feels like—like flying.”

Lilya could feel her heart hammering. She’d never thought too much about sex, but the way Natalya talked about it had stirred something inside her. Eva, too, was looking at Natalya intently. Natalya looked sheepish.

“Well, I’m going to go to bed. Tomorrow’s a big day.”

Some time later, Lilya lay in bed, warm under her covers, gently tracing the insides of her thighs with her fingernails. Sleepiness began to creep over her at last. “Natalya?” she asked quietly. She heard a rustle to her left.

“Mmm?”

“Anton… did you love him?”

There was a long pause. “Yes. I suppose I did.”

//// September 4, 1941

Dawn broke clear and bright the next morning. Adrenaline rushed through Lilya, and she sprang out of bed. Time to fly! After an impatient breakfast, she filed out behind Katya with the other girls. Natalya seemed just as excited as Lilya, and her face was lit up with joy. Esfir was as inscrutable as ever, while Kaede’s face was set in a determined frown. Eva, meanwhile, looked terrified. Her eyes were fixed on the airstrip, where her Yak-1 awaited her. Wordlessly, she followed Katya towards the aircraft. “You’ll be fine, Eva!” called Natalya.

Lilya set aside her thoughts of her friends as Andrei helped her into the cockpit of her own aircraft. “I’ve finished all of my safety checks, and she’s ready to fly. Make sure you bring down the fuel richness once—ah! What am I saying! You know all of this. Don’t listen to me.” Lilya gave the kindly man a smile as she settled into the cockpit. The glass enclosure had grown surprising warm in the sunlight, and she found herself perspiring slightly under her coat. She felt a sudden twinge in her bladder brought on by anxiety. I wish I’d used the bathroom before we went out. 

She put her discomfort out of her mind and focused on the various switches, dials, and gauges laid out in front of her. She moved the controls stick between her legs, and saw the ailerons respond smoothly on each wing. She connected her radio to her headset, and a moment later heard Katya’s voice crackle to life. “Engines on, ladies. Let’s get in the air.” Lilya flipped a couple of switches, then turned on the starter motor. The massive propellor blades swept across the windshield, quickly gaining speed. When the spinning blades became a blur, she pressed the ignition.

The engine roared to life, rattling the cockpit. Lilya caught the intoxicating scent of smoke and petrol as the engine warmed up, like a great beast stretching its legs after slumber.

Natalya took off first, then Esfir, then Kaede; all three without incident. Then the runway was clear, and it was her turn.

“Blocks away!” she called, and her ground crew hurried to pull out the wooden stops that held her wheels in place. “Clear!” came the reply. Her plane began to roll forward slowly. She used the rudder to swing the tail around until she was pointed straight down the airfield. The sky beckoned. Lilya took a deep breath, then pushed the throttle forward all the way.

The engine’s roar became a howl. The vibrations lessened, like a horse finding its stride, and the plane started to move. Faster and faster, Lilya raced down the runway, her heart hammering in her chest. There was no going back now! She pitched forward slightly and the tail lifted off the ground—the plane was now running along on just the front two wheels. Then she pointed the nose upwards, and the plane sprang into the air.

In an instant, her worries vanished, like they always did when she was flying. She darted over the treetops, close enough to rustle branches in her wake as she picked up speed, then raised her landing gear and pulled up into the sky. Despite its size, her plane performed as well as any she had ever flown. She darted this way and that, pushing the aircraft harder and harder. Yakovlev responded strongly each time; triangular wings flexing under the strain.

“Lilya, the purpose of this flight is to get acquainted with the handling of the aircraft, not tear it to shreds.” Katya spoke dryly over the radio. “I don’t think we have any spare wings back at base, and if you snap one off it will be a terrible hassle to order a replacement.”

Lilya smiled. “Okay, sorry—I mean, roger that!”

The next half an hour passed in a blur. As Katya was primarily focused on instructing Eva, it was left to the four other girls to practice some basic rolls and loops, none of which presented much difficulty to Lilya. The atmosphere was nothing short of jovial. The girls laughed, joked, and sang together as they got a feel for their planes. Even Kaede and Esfir—who, to that point, Lilya had hardly even shared a conversation with—seemed happy and relaxed in the sky. She heard Esfir singing in a clear contralto,

Časovye perekliknulisʹ v noči:

Podpolzaet vrag, skvozʹ veter i tuman.

Ukraincy, belorusy, moskviči,

Vyletaem my na Tihij okean,

My letim na Tihij okean!

They also attempted flying in formation, forming up diagonally in a single line like geese. This was far more difficult than it looked—Lilya had never flown in tandem with other aircraft before, and she struggled to match her speed to her comrades. To make matters worse, her need to pee was building steadily. The tricky thing about flying a plane was that she needed both her legs and arms to maintain control, so she couldn’t hold herself. She couldn’t even clench her legs together, since the control stick ran between them. “Lilya! What’s going on?” demanded Esfir as Lilya drifted past her, breaking formation once again.

“Sorry,” muttered Lilya through gritted teeth. “I have to…” …piss, she almost said, but remembered that Katya was still in radio range. “...do better.” She finished lamely.

Mercifully, her fuel gauge was now down to a quarter of a tank, and the four girls turned back towards the airstrip (Eva and Katya had already landed). Lilya was now dragging in long shaky breaths as she fought to keep her aching bladder under control. She could fly the plane one-handed for a few seconds at a time—allowing her to jam her free hand into her crotch—but she needed the strength of both hands to make significant adjustments to her trajectory. Every time she pulled her hand away, her need to pee rebounded more strongly. It was torture; she was aware that on the ground she would not have been in danger of wetting herself, but with her legs forced open and no way to properly hold herself her desperation was almost unbearable.

She was channeling all of her strength into her urethral muscles, but they were tiring quickly. She knew that she was almost out of time. As the airfield crept back into view, Lilya pulled ahead of her peers. “I’ll land first,” she announced, praying that nobody would contradict her. She sighed with relief when the other three stayed quiet. She angled her nose down, cut her throttle, and lined up her approach. “Come on, come on,” she muttered under her breath. She was squirming in her seat now, desperately trying to close her legs but still unable to. She forced herself to stay still, squeezing her aching muscles so hard that tears sprung into her eyes. “Focus, focus…” Her landing flaps were down now, and her altitude was dropping steadily. In a few seconds she would be on the ground, and she could squeeze her crotch as hard as she wanted. “Almost there…”

“Lilya!” Natalya’s voice was shrill. “Your landing gear is still up!” Lilya’s stomach plunged in fear. She jerked back the stick, aborting her landing just a few meters from the ground. She slammed open the throttle and prayed the aircraft wouldn’t stall. The engine stumbled, and for a horrifying second Lilya thought she would crash, but then the V12 roared back to life. The plane clawed its way back into the air with a billow of black smoke.

It was at this moment that Lilya’s dam started to break. The upwards acceleration of the plane pushed Lilya down into her seat and multiplied the weight of her overfilled bladder. It felt like there was a leaden mass pressing against the inside of her pee-hole, and her exhausted muscles simply could not take the strain. “No!” she exclaimed helplessly as the first couple of drops trickled out, soaking her crotch. She set her jaw and clenched her pelvic muscles as hard as she could, but it was a futile effort—the trickle of pee escaping her bladder was growing into a stream. 

Her panties were now completely soaked, and she was seconds away from wetting the back of her pants and the seat below. She could already feel the first hot rivulets making their way down her ass cheeks. Her pee hole burned and stung from its protracted battle, and she very nearly consigned herself to a complete wetting, but the thought of defiling her aircraft on her very first flight was too much to bear. She shoved her left hand into her panties, pressing the tip of her middle finger as hard as she could against her urethra. The plane veered alarmingly, but she found she was just strong enough to control the aircraft one-handed.

Lilya clenched the control stick hard to keep her hand from shaking with shock. How could I have let this happen? She had very nearly botched her landing and wet herself in the process, all because she hadn’t used the bathroom that morning. Anger flared inside her, overpowering her desperation. She wasn’t going to give up. She wasn’t going to piss herself in the cockpit and embarrass the entire squadron. She could hold her bladder like a grown woman, and enjoy the bliss of relieving herself once she was in the safety of the bathroom. But first, she had to get her plane on the ground.

“I’m circling back around.” Her voice was level and confident. Her desperation was still there—an intensifying throb in her lower abdomen—but she didn’t care. She wasn’t even trying to clench her muscles anymore; she simply blocked her pee hole with her finger. The pain radiating from the sensitive tissue was ignored. She banked around smoothly, lining up the air strip in front of her once more. She leveled out the plane, lowered her landing gear and cut the throttle. This required taking her hand out of her panties, but it felt like her muscles had recovered enough to hold for a minute or two. 

A couple seconds later, the green “landing gear down” light flicked on, and she touched down on the runway smoothly—a perfect landing. That’s more like it! She braked as hard as she dared, killed the engine, then opened the cockpit and hopped out almost before the propellor had stopped spinning. Andrei hurried out towards her, looking concerned. “I saw your gear didn’t come down on the first pass—is there something wrong with—”

“Just a mistake, Andrei!” Lilya called over her shoulder as she raced to the barracks, still giddy with emotion. “She flew beautifully. Thank you!”

A few seconds later she was inside the barracks. She groaned in relief as the door closed behind her—she’d made it back dry! More or less! Her nervousness was fading, and in its place was a mischievous sort of excitement. She felt like a naughty farmgirl again, swiping pastries out of the oven and scampering away without getting caught. A tingle went down her spine. She was ready to admit it to herself—there was something undeniably exciting about waiting to pee until the last possible moment.

She could see the two toilet stalls at the far end of the room, their doors cracked open invitingly. The sight of the toilets was enough to send a spasm through her bladder, which now felt swollen and rock-hard. She was once again near her limit—the point where squirming and bouncing no longer helped to relieve her need. Instead, she tried to relax her core and give her bladder room to expand. She felt the burning urge to release her piss, but she did not fight it. It was almost meditative, in a degenerate sort of way.

Now that she knew she was safe, Lilya felt a perverse urge to push her desperation just a bit farther. Instead of dashing directly to the toilet, she forced herself to walk with ladylike composure to her own bedside cabinet. It wasn’t proper to wear shoes indoors—shouldn’t she take them off first?

With mincing steps, she made her way to the front of her cabinet. She bent down to unlace her boots, but stopped halfway with a gasp of pain as her bladder spasmed once again. Her pelvic muscles quivered ominously. That’s no good… She tried sitting on her bed and reaching down, but once again was deterred by a warning cry from her bladder. It was overfilled to the point where it could no longer change shape; any pressure that was applied to it was transferred directly to her aching pee-hole. Lilya’s head was spinning. It was maddening beyond belief to be so close to release, but to be held back by an inability to take off her shoes.

Still, she wasn’t ready to give up. She sat down on the floor, and tucked one of her feet in towards her hips while sitting up straight. This had the disadvantage of opening her legs, but at least it didn’t compress her bladder as severely. With one hand clamped over her soaking wet crotch, she managed to unlace one of her boots one-handed and pull it off. Switching hands, she repeated the feat with the other boot. With one last effort, she dragged herself to her feet. Her bladder was now throbbing with every beat of her heart, tortured to its breaking point. Lilya was unable to stand upright; she shuffled hunched-over towards the nearest stall with one hand glued between her legs and the other gingerly supporting her distended bladder. She whimpered under her breath as she took step after mincing step. “Hah… hah!”

And then she made it. She shouldered open the door and practically threw herself down on the toilet, pulling her pants and sodden panties down at the same time. Knowing that she was completely alone, she couldn’t resist a louder-than-necessary moan of satisfaction as her urine exploded out of her. It was a moment of pure bliss; every second of her prolonged hold seemed worth it.

Then she noticed the bathroom door was still open, and a jolt of alarm swept over her, cutting off her stream abruptly. Memories flooded back of the first time she had used this toilet. She’d left the door open then as well, but that time she hadn’t been alone… Lilya’s cheeks flushed at the memory. She reached out to close the door, but something stayed her hand. She didn’t really need to close the door, did she? There was nobody watching. And wasn’t it, well, more exciting to pee like this, her pussy spread open in clear sight of the doorway? She exhaled a shaky breath, and relaxed enough to restart her stream. She imagined Katya barging through the door, the severe lines of her uniform matched by her expression of utter contempt. ‘You dirty girl,’ her commander sneered.

Lilya felt her hand drifting inexorably towards her clit as the Katya of her fantasy approached her. ‘You wanted me to find out what a pathetic slut you are, didn’t you?’ Lilya’s hand moved in frantic circles as she imagined Natalya appearing next to Katya, her beautiful face lit up with laughter. ‘See Katya? I told you I was right about that farmgirl whore. What shall we do with her?’ Lilya’s orgasm ripped through her body like a summer storm. When she came to her senses she was shivering on the toilet; her panties around her ankles, the warmth of her afterglow quickly fading. She felt nauseous with guilt. What is wrong with me? She forced herself to move, trying to leave behind the brume of her disgust. Outside, she heard another plane touch down—in a couple minutes, the whole squadron would be on the ground, and her absence would be noticed. She hurried to her dresser, changed out of her sodden pants and panties, and went outside.

////

All six Yak-1s had landed successfully, and the ground crews were hauling the aircraft back to their hangars. Esfir, Natalya, and Kaede all seemed relaxed and happy, but Eva looked ecstatic. The high-born girl beamed at Lilya as she walked to rejoin her companions. Her training must have gone well! Lilya saw Katya striding towards them, and the five girls straightened to attention.

“Otlichnaya rabota, ladies. Well done! Although your formation flying needs some work, along with your familiarity with your aircraft—” she cast a sidelong glance at Lilya, who blushed, “—I was impressed with your overall piloting proficiency and cooperation. And you will all be pleased to know that Eva had an excellent flight with me. When we are ready to fly our first sortie together, Eva will be in the air with us!” The stern commander afforded Eva a rare smile. Her comrades gave her an impromptu round of applause, and Eva looked like she might melt on the spot.

“Under normal training conditions, you all would have six weeks to learn the intricacies of aerial combat. However, the current situation on the battlefield will not allow this. We have two weeks—at most.” The girls fidgeted.

“We will break now for lunch, and then go back in the air until nightfall. Winter is around the corner, and we must make the most of the daylight while we have it. Dismissed!”

Lilya was turning for the barracks when she heard her commander speak again in a lower tone. “Litvyak—wait a moment.” Lilya felt a pit of dread in her stomach; she could guess what this conversation would be about. She swallowed and turned to face her commander once more as the other girls filed away.

“You flew well today,” began Katya. “You gained confidence in your new aircraft with remarkable speed. Furthermore, in your brief time here at Bukhta you have shown diligence in your training. For these reasons, I was surprised to see your focus begin to slip near the end of our training exercises. And even more surprised when you failed to lower your landing gear on your first approach.” Lilya’s cheeks burned red.

“The lack of discipline you demonstrated today could easily have gotten you injured or killed. And in battle, it could have done far worse; it may have jeopardized the lives your comrades-in-arms. Fighter planes do not suffer fools, Lilya.” Lilya looked away in shame, wishing she could burrow into the ground like a vole.

“I cannot put any member of this squadron at risk on your account, Lilya. So answer me truthfully—what happened today?”

Lilya felt tears of embarrassment well in her eyes, but she forced herself to meet her commander’s gaze. “It won’t happen again. All that happened was… I just really had to pee. I didn’t think about it before I got in the plane, and once I got in the air it was too late. I was on the verge of wetting myself by the time I landed. But it won’t happen again, I promise!”

Katya’s gaze softened. “I see. Well, it certainly could be worse; you aren’t the first pilot to be caught in those circumstances. I’m glad to know there was a reason for your mistakes beyond simple incompetence. Just make sure this does not happen again! You are dismissed, Private Litvyak.”

Lilya nodded in acknowledgement and gratitude, and the two women began walking back to the barracks for lunch. “And one more thing, Lilya. When you find yourself desperate to pee while flying… it’s better to let go and wet yourself. Your life is worth far more than your dignity.”

Thank you all for all the kind words 🙂 It's cool to see the speculation but I don't want to ruin the fun hehe.

Yeah I'm trying to post at least once a week. I work M-F so it seems I usually end up posting on weekends but if I can post more often I will!

//// September 17, 1941

The next two weeks flew by. Katya pushed her squadron hard, and from sunup to sundown the girls trained together in the sky, trying to make the most of the shortening autumn days. They practiced their formations until they could fly together in a perfect wing3. Katya taught them how to identify landmarks from the air, and gauge distances to faraway targets. They also learned a separate skill: flying by instrument. It meant relying on nothing more than the gauges in the cockpit to determine where you were and where you were going—no easy feat, but potentially life-saving when visibility was poor.

Katya didn’t just teach her pilots how to fly; she taught them how to kill. Again and again, Lilya and the other girls would make strafing runs on a truck-sized aluminum sheet set up in a clearing in the forest. Occasionally, Lilya would see a bright flash on the piece of metal as one of her explosive rounds found its mark, but more often they sailed wide. It was devilishly tricky to keep the plane’s nose on a target while flying, especially since the recoil of the guns would rock the entire aircraft. “Remember,” Katya told them as they circled around to line up another run, “it’s much harder to hit anything that’s moving. Not just because you have to lead them with your shots, but also, the people inside will be trying their hardest not to be hit. The first time you fire in combat, I promise you that you will miss. You will need to get closer to your target than you think, and lead your target more than you think.”

If strafing was hard, bombing was even harder. The Yak-1 could carry a small forged-steel bomb under each wing (“small” in the context of aviation, anyways; it took two men to haul them around), and both bombs could be dropped by the pilot at the same time with the press of a button. Knowing when to drop your bombs was less a question of piloting and more of mathematics: as soon as the bomb detached from the airframe it began to decelerate horizontally and accelerate towards the ground. The easiest—and for that matter, the only—way to hit any target smaller than a village was to dive in at a steep angle and release at very low altitude. But not too low or too fast, unless you wanted to add your aircraft to the payload. It was several days of practice before Lilya started to get her dummy bombs on target.

When the girls weren’t in the air, they were studying; soaking in as much as they could about combat theory, communication protocol, aircraft silhouettes, map-reading, parachuting, and even survival skills in the event that they were forced to bail out far from base. For hours after Katya retired each night, the five of them would stay up, huddled around the mess hall table, poring over training documents. Though the five of them had their differences, circumstance had brought them together, and Lilya knew they would either succeed or fail as a team.

For Lilya, it was exhausting. It was also the happiest time of her life.

“I’m so sore!” groused Eva at dinner, as the girls tucked in hungrily to porridge prepared by Kaede. “I understand the importance of training as much as we can, but I’m so stiff from flying that I can hardly get up in the morning! And yes, Natalya,” she added, catching her teasing look, “I’m a fragile princess who isn’t used to real work. But still!”

“Well, you know what the boys say,” quipped Natalya. “Treat your airplane like you treat your woman: get inside her five times a day and take her to heaven and back!” Lilya sprayed a mouthful of tea across the table. “Very nice, Natalya,” Eva said daintily, trying and failing to suppress a smile. “A proper lady of the Soviet Union you are!”

There was a certain energy around the table that night. Tomorrow, ready or not, the squadron would be flying out on their first mission.

“So, is it true, Eva?” Lilya asked intently. “Will you get to fly with us tomorrow?”

“It is!” Eva replied excitedly. “Katya cleared me today. I’m still a long way from being as good as you all, of course, but at I’m happy I can at least do something.”

Lilya understood the sentiment. At night, they could pick up radio stations from Moscow, and the news was never good. The Red Army was putting up a valiant fight, but they were being forced back towards the capital. Moscow might be encircled in weeks. And worse, the Luftwaffe had control of the air. Every time Lilya took off, she knew that there were German fighters hunting the skies for her. Another month of training would be good; another year even better. But the Soviet Union was out of time.

“I think we should take the night off,” said Natalya abruptly. “No more studying today. Eva’s getting her wings, and we’re all about to fly on our first mission. This is cause for celebration!” And with that, she dashed out of the room. Eva caught Lilya’s eye apologetically.

A moment later, Natalya bounded back into the mess hall, clutching a bottle of vodka. “I’ve been saving this for something special,” she said eagerly, talking over Eva’s stammered protest. “And what better time than our de-facto graduation?” Lilya almost objected, but she was powerless to resist Natalya’s smile. Esfir shrugged. “I’m not one to turn down good vodka,” the short-haired girl said easily. Kaede nodded in agreement. “All right!” exclaimed Eva, wringing her hands. “But I swear to god, Natalya, if you crash and die tomorrow because you’re hungover, I will find your corpse and kill you.”

////

Lilya lounged haphazardly on the floor, laughing helplessly, arranged in a circle with Eva, Kaede, Esfir and Natalya. Her muscles felt oddly relaxed, and her head hummed pleasantly. Lilya had never been much of a drinker, and certainly she’d never tasted any liquor as smooth as Natalya’s offering. By comparison, the samogon she’d had back home had tasted as harsh as petrol. The bottle was almost empty, and the pilots were all in varying stages of intoxication. Playing cards were scattered around them; they’d had a game going at one point, but it had been abandoned. Lilya couldn’t remember why. For that matter, she couldn’t even remember what they had been playing.

Kaede burst into laughter as Natalya related a rather graphic story involving her and Anton. Her large dark eyes, normally so hard to read, sparkled with happiness. When she saw Lilya was looking at her, she caught her gaze and smiled.

“…and to be honest, I can’t say I was too unhappy about it,” concluded Natalya. “And I was able to sneak home and get my hair clean before anyone noticed.” She sighed. “I suppose I would have been angry, but it was all just too much fun.” She straightened up and adopted a mock-serious tone. “That’s a lesson for all of you young bachelors: if you want to land yourself a nice girl, you don’t have to be handsome or rich. You just have to make them smile.”

Kaede giggled. “I didn’t know you knew so much about charming women!”

Natalya smirked. “Oh, me? No, I’m not the expert in that department.” She turned to Esfir, and gave her a knowing wink. Perhaps it was meant to be discreet, but the influence of alcohol had greatly reduced Natalya’s subtlety.

Esfir shifted. “What’s that supposed to mean?” Against the background hum in Lilya’s head, Esfir’s voice was uncomfortably sharp. Natalya immediately went on the defensive. “Oh, come on,” she said plaintively. “I can put two and two together. I have instincts. A girl like you—strong, beautiful—I bet the ladies can’t get enough of you!”

Perhaps it was the flattery that did the trick. Esfir held her gaze for a moment, then grinned ruefully and flicked her hair back out of her bright blue eyes. “Fuck, is it really so obvious? All right then, you win. I’ve been with a woman before. Well, more than one, for that matter.”

A ripple of interest spread through the group. Eva was sitting straight as a board, her cheeks flushed. Lilya felt blood rushing in her ears.

“What?!” Kaede exclaimed, leaning forward. “But… you said your family lived in the country…how?”

Natalya offered the short-haired girl the bottle. “Come on, Esfir, I’ve already said too much about my sex life. You have to tell!”

Esfir hesitated, then took the bottle and downed a long swig, wincing appreciatively as she swallowed. “All right, but you are all perverts for asking. Here’s how it happened.

“As I’ve said before, my father worked as a hunter and trapper. We lived outside Livadya. Not far from Yalta. It is the most beautiful place in Crimea. Probably, in the world.

“As such, there are two types of people in my town: those who actually live and work here and wealthy travelers from Moscow, St. Petersburg, and beyond. Before the war broke out, there were even some foreigners. Men travel here to hunt, you see. There is a famous lodge—Red Deer Lodge—where they stay with their families. And during the hunting season, when the lodge was busiest, I worked at the restaurant inside.

“When I was working, it was clear to me that many of these women did not want to be there. Take away the hunting and the forest, and there is nothing to do in my town except to drink and feel sorry for yourself. And so, many of them did just that; these women of status, reduced to parlor games and staring at the trees, hating their husbands.

“And then I walk in, this friendly serving boy, and these ladies were practically lining up to flirt with me. Oh, I don’t think most of them knew I was a girl—not at first. Although… they knew there was something different about me. But that was part of the appeal. They wanted an escape, and when I took them back to my room that’s what I gave them.”

Eva’s cheeks were flushed. Her hands shook slightly as she twisted them together. “I don’t know, Esfir, it… it doesn’t seem right.”

Esfir scoffed. “I’m a lesbian from backwoods fucking nowhere, Eva. What was I supposed to do? Ask them to the ball? Have my daddy arrange a nice marriage with a noblewoman? Not all of us had our lives handed to us. Everything I got, I had to take.”

“A nice marriage!” Eva’s whole body was trembling now, and her voice was uneven. “A sweet little girl, served a perfect life on a silver plate! Is that what I look like to you? I’m going to be dead before the year is out—I know it, you all know it. I’d never even driven a car before I got here. I don’t know how to fly! Do you think this is part of my daddy’s perfect plan for my life of luxury? Do you think he got me enlisted because he loves who I am?”

Lilya saw a strange look flash across Esfir’s face. “Sorry,” she muttered.

Eva hiccupped and smiled tearfully. “I’m sorry, too. I’m not used to drinking so much. My outburst was… un-ladylike.”

Natalya was unable to suppress a guffaw. “Eva, not to put too fine of a point on it, but we’re not in the ballroom anymore. I think the rules of decorum are slightly less strict on a military base. Besides,” she added slyly, “if I remember correctly, our introduction to Lieutenant Budanova wasn’t very ladylike either!”

Eva and Natalya giggled helplessly in mutual embarrassment; Lilya joined in, but Kaede looked confused. “What happened?” The Sakhalin girl asked. “I wasn’t there.”

“Well!” said Natalya with a broad grin. “It was a very long truck ride to the base, you see, and—”

“Natalya, please!” Eva exclaimed, her face bright red.

“Well, you tell her or I will—”

“All right, all right!” She gave in with a sigh. “I suppose you’ll find out anyways, and it might as well be from me. As Natalya was saying, the ride up here dragged on for hours and hours…” Eva briskly recounted the story of how first she, and then Natalya had wet themselves on the runway. Lilya felt her cheeks tingling with secondhand embarrassment, and she took a long swig from the bottle to distract herself, but Eva kept her poise.

“After that, there was nothing to do but go inside and get changed, really. To be honest, I can’t believe you didn’t notice when we walked in! My tights were soaked…”

Kaede smiled shyly. “I guess I was distracted—all I really remember was Lilya sprinting to the bathroom!” Lilya’s stomach plunged—she had been wondering when her name would get pulled into the tale. Still, given the stories the other girls had told about themselves, she had no grounds to object. “I remember I pointed you towards the bathroom and you ran straight in,” Kaede continued. “You didn’t even close the door. And then you—” Kaede saw the look of panic on Lilya’s face and stopped talking. How much did she see? Wetting yourself was humiliating, but it was an honest mistake that could happen to anyone with enough bad luck. But if the other girls knew that she had touched herself in the aftermath, Lilya thought she might die of embarrassment.

Kaede seemed to wrestle with herself for a moment, then spoke again in a deliberately offhand way:

“Did it feel good?”

“I—I’m not sure what—.” Lilya’s pulse was hammering so hard that she was sure the other girls could hear it. “Well, I mean, yeah, sure! I guess the relief felt good, that’s all. Like taking off a heavy pack, or something.”

“Oh.” Kaede looked away. “Right, of course.”

Lilya fiddled with her shirt hem. “Why do you ask?”

Kaede flicked her eyes from one girl to the next like a cornered animal. She took a deep breath and exhaled shakily. “Well, I’ve never told anyone this, but… ah! It’s so embarrassing. But seeing as you all have been open with me…

“I don’t remember exactly when it started, or how, but when I was younger I realized that… I liked the sensation of needing to pee. There is just something… exciting about it for me.

“I grew up in the city, and I was always running chores for my mother. When she sent me to the store to buy something, I would always drink as much as I could right before I left. It was a two kilometer walk each way… by the time I got to the store I would already feel the urge, and by the time I paid and left it was hard not to fidget. I think the owner knew, because he always had this smirk on his face as he said goodbye, but he never said anything.

“The walk home would be torture. I would feel my bladder getting heavier and heavier and there was nothing I could do to relieve the pressure. I just had to keep walking. But that was the exciting part for me; I never knew for sure if I would make it. If something went wrong—if a road was blocked off, or I had to turn around because I had forgotten something, I would be in real trouble. The worst would be if I ran into somebody I knew in the street. I had to smile and stand up straight while they talked on and on, not realizing I was bursting on the inside. More than once, I had to dash into an alleyway and pee behind whatever cover I could find. I always tried to make it back, though.”

“Did you ever wet yourself?” Lilya asked.

Kaede bit her lip. “Once. About a year ago.

“I was on my way back from the store with a bag of groceries. There had been a long line at the store, so by the time I was ten minutes from home I was already very desperate to pee. Then, I heard somebody call my name.

“It was a girl from my school and one of her friends. She was holding some money in her hand. I realized what had happened; somehow, my money had fallen out of my bag. I asked her to give it back, but she laughed at me and said no.

“I was trapped. I knew my mother would be angry with me if I came home without the money, but I didn’t know what to do to get it back. There was no way I could have fought both of them, especially in the state I was in. I tried pleading with them, threatening them, but they just giggled at me.

“By then, they’d realized how badly I needed to pee. The girl and her friend told me that they wouldn’t give me back the money unless I wet myself, right there on the city street. I didn’t want to, but I was about to pee myself anyways.

“I don’t think they really expected me to do it. I still remember the look of shock on their faces… the front of my skirt was completely soaked. They tossed down the money and left.

“By all accounts, that should have been the end of my adventures, but it wasn’t. To tell you the truth… it was the most exciting thing that ever happened to me. On the trips where I made it all the way back home intact, I would rush to the bathroom and—and masturbate as soon as I stopped peeing. That day though… I could barely make it back to the house. Not because I needed to pee, but because I wanted to touch myself.”

Lilya felt dazed. The alcohol was really working on her now, and she felt her vision starting to slip in and out of focus. Was any of this real? She bit her tongue. It hurt.

“Well Kaede, if I’m able to remember anything in the morning, I’m sure I’ll regret saying this, but that story was hot as hell. And your intuition was correct… you’re not the only one who gets turned on by…that sort of thing. I’ve never tried it before we got here, but…” She trailed off as she looked into Kaede’s dark brown eyes. She’d never appreciated until now just how beautiful the mixed-race girl was. The warm lamplight was dancing over her high cheekbones, her slightly parted lips… Lilya suddenly realized how close together the two of them were sitting. She could reach out and—

“It’s late!”

Eva’s voice sounded echoey and faraway, as if she were at the end of a long hallway. Lilya turned away hurriedly, which made her head spin. She did her best to focus on Eva’s face, but couldn’t seem to concentrate. It’s time to sleep. She was dimly aware of someone helping her into bed, and then her world went dark.

//// September 18, 1941

If I could forget everything that happened last night, would I want to?

Lilya spent breakfast the next morning lost in thought. The meal was an unusually muted affair; their inaugural combat mission seemed less exciting and more terrifying now that it was less than an hour away. For her own part, Lilya almost welcomed the chance to put the awkwardness of last night behind her. On one hand, the secret of her own sexual deviance was out. On the other… she wasn’t alone. She caught Kaede’s eye before she could help herself, and smiled shyly. Kaede blushed, and looked down at her plate.

A few moments later, Katya stood up, and with a rumbling of chairs the other girls hastened to emulate their commander. “Ladies, it’s time. Proceed to your aircraft, and form up on me once you’re in the air. We will be making a sweep due south towards Moscow, looking for vulnerable German air and ground targets. I cannot predict the outcome of our mission, but I can assure you this—our best chance of success is to stay together and communicate closely. Pognali!”

A shiver ran down Lilya’s spine. She was about to step out of the barracks towards her waiting aircraft when she felt a hand on her shoulder. It was Natalya, a cheeky grin on her face. “Lilya, my dear, you might want to use the bathroom before we take off.” Lilya giggled. “Screw you, but also, you’re right.” She turned around and dashed to the toilet.

////

“Heading one eight five, airspeed four hundred and ten, altitude five thousand one hundred feet.” Katya’s voice was as cool as ever over the radio as the six pilots pushed south. “We’re about eighty kilometers northwest of Moscow. Continue to stay alert.” Lilya sat up straighter, looking keenly for movement in the sky, the flash of a mortar on the ground—anything that might denote German presence. So far, apart from a couple of false alarms, the mission had been uneventful. She had felt certain that they would have encountered something by now, but Katya seemed unsurprised. “Remember, we’re not flying on the frontlines,” their commander reminded them. “We’re looking to surprise the Germans behind enemy lines, where they’re weak. Consequently, any planes or vehicles we do encounter are probably trying to hide from us.”

A few minutes later, Katya gave the order to turn around, and the squadron headed due north, returning on a slightly different route than the one they had arrived on. Lilya was feeling more relaxed, and although they were still limiting radio communication to avoid detection, she sensed just from the way they flew that the other girls were loosening up as well. She was already looking forward to a hot lunch before they set off again in the afternoon. But then—

“Bogey spotted! Ten-o-clock, low!” Esfir’s voice was shaky with excitement. Lilya craned her neck, and sure enough, she saw a dark speck racing westwards just over the treeline. She reached frantically for the binoculars she kept in her pants pocket and peered through them, but her hands were shaking too badly to bring the aircraft into focus. She took a deep breath to steady herself.

“Good eye, Esfir.” Katya’s low, steady voice was a tonic for Lilya’s nerves. “It looks like a Junkers eighty-eight. Two-engined bomber, with a couple of turrets. Judging by its trajectory it’s coming back from a bombing run and got separated. There’s no fighter escort to be seen—let’s bring him down.” Lilya followed her commander as she banked her plane to the left and dove towards their quarry.

It was all Lilya could do to keep from panicking as they raced towards the bomber, gaining quickly on the heavier plane. The enemy aircraft loomed into view: a powerfully built plane more than twice the size of the Yak-1, with a large engine mounted on each wing. A puff of smoke issued from each engine and the Ju-88 adjusted course—the Soviet squadron had been spotted. The bomber was now racing just above treetop level as fast as it could, but the Yakovlevs continued to close.

A series of bright flashes erupted from the tail of the bomber, and before she could make sense of what she was seeing, Lilya heard the ­crack­-crack-crack of incoming machine-gun fire. A hail of tracer rounds whipped past her. None of them found their mark, but the effect on the squadron was immediate. Everyone but Katya broke formation at the same time in a frantic attempt to avoid the gunfire. Lilya felt horribly exposed. At least on the ground, you could try to hide from someone shooting at you. But up in the sky, her only protection was a small pane of bulletproof glass on her windshield.

“Stay on target!” Katya was saying. “You’re never going to bring him down running around like scared rabbits! No gunner is going to hit you from this range. Now, line up an angle and stick to it! Remember—you’re going to have to get close!”

Chiding herself, Lilya pulled up level to the enemy aircraft, so that it was to her right and beneath her, then turned in to attack from the side. The German pilot was flying well—by staying so close to the ground, it would be difficult for the Soviet squadron to dive on him without crashing. Lilya would have to dive as close as she could, fire, and then pull up hard before she collided with the treetops. She rested her thumb on the fire button at the top of her control stick. Truth be told, she had very little confidence in her gunmanship. She’d shot rifles on the farm occasionally, but firing while flying was something else altogether. In order to line up a shot, she had to adjust the rudder and elevator perfectly. It was like trying to shoot something by controlling a marionette that was holding a rifle. Not for the first time, Lilya wished they’d had more time to practice.

She continued to dive towards the bomber until she could see the black-and-white crosses on each wing. Now! She opened fire, cursed, then pulled up hard to level out from her dive. Her tracer rounds had sailed well above and behind the bomber—she hadn’t come close to hitting her mark. She recovered altitude, and prepared for another pass.

For ten minutes, the fight wore on. The German bomber was now stitched with holes, and steam was billowing from the left engine. Still, it kept plowing westward, and from time to time the dorsal gunner would unleash a burst of machinegun fire. The other turrets had been silent for a while, though; Lilya didn’t want to think about why that was. After many failed attempts, she had finally scored some hits against the Ju-88. She was slowly getting more comfortable with leading her shots, and had been rewarded with a series of firecracker-like explosions as some of her cannon-rounds detonated on the bomber’s fuselage. She was running low on ammunition, however, and many of the other girls were as well. Time and again she scoured the horizon, expecting at any moment to see German reinforcements, but none came.

She was getting ready for another attack run when she saw it—the German plane’s left engine had finally given out. The propellors were no longer a blur; they spun slowly now, like a child’s toy. “That’s enough,” said Katya. “Form up on me, and let’s get back to base.” Lilya did as she was told, looking over her shoulder at the fatally wounded bomber as she did so. It was flying impossibly slowly now; almost hanging in the air. A minute later, it was gone.

Back at base, the atmosphere was light. Sure, it hadn’t all been smooth sailing, but they’d all made it back safe and sound, and scored their first victory to boot. The Yakovlevs had all fared well, and apart from a bullet that had punched a small hole through Katya’s right wing, none of them had taken damage (“nothing a piece of aluminum tape won’t fix,” Katya had said). Even so, Lilya didn’t feel like celebrating. 

As she lay in bed that night, she could still feel the phantom sensations of flying: the g-forces of pulling out of a dive, the bone-jarring shake of the cockpit when she had opened fire. There had been one point, as she was flying past the bomber, when she had seen the dorsal gunner’s face. She was moving too quickly for him to bring his machinegun to bear, but he had followed her with his head as she raced by, and she had done the same. For the briefest of moments, they had looked at each other. His face had been smooth-shaven and pale, and impossibly young. The goggles he had been wearing shielded his eyes. Lilya wondered if he had been as scared as she was.

Thanks again for all of the feedback. Yes, I don't pretend to be writing a story that is historically accurate! When writing this I tried to walk the line between grounding it in realism and shaping the story the way I want it. For what it's worth, the irl Lilya did fly a Yak-1, although I don't think she was active so early in the war. Your point is well taken, and I hope everyone reading can enjoy the story without it being to immersion-breaking.

I've got a huge section to post today! I will post it in two segments.

//// October 1, 1941

Lilya felt cold.

Raised on a Russian farm, she was no stranger to harsh weather. But she’d never been this far north, and she could already tell that the coming winter would be a brutal one. The barracks they now called home had been hastily built, and cold drafts seemed to sneak inside from invisible holes in the plaster. This morning, the drafts were worse than ever, and Lilya could hear a faint creaking overhead as the building shifted in the wind. There was a storm coming.

Her skin prickled as she forced herself out of bed. She stripped down quickly and stepped into her trousers. She’d lost a bit of weight, she noticed as she buttoned them up. Well, going to war will do that to you.

It had been two weeks since their first mission, and a full month since Lilya had arrived at Bukhta airbase. From sunrise to sunset, she spent most of her time in the sky, flying sorties morning, afternoon and evening. Sometimes the squadron would scout for the beleaguered ground troops of the Red Army; once, they had provided an escort for a formation of IL-2 attack aircraft. Most of the time, however, they simply flew behind enemy lines with no particular target, stalking the skies in search of vulnerable prey. There had been a few close calls—Esfir had nearly lost her engine after being hit by flak, and they squadron had barely avoided detection by a large formation of German fighter planes—but so far, none of the girls had come to harm. It felt like borrowed time to Lilya.

Thirty minutes later, Lilya stepped out onto the airfield with the rest of her squadron and was immediately buffeted by an icy blast of wind. She looked up—the sky was clear overhead, but a heavy line of clouds was marching in from the south. Esfir followed her line of sight, then swore out loud. “Katya, I don’t like the look of that weather!”

“That’s Lieutenant Budanova to you, private,” Katya replied evenly. “We’ll have time to get back before the front arrives.” Esfir chewed her lip and nodded.

To avoid flying into the incoming weather, the squadron abandoned their usual route towards Moscow and instead flew northwest, towards the besieged city of Leningrad. In the preceding month, the Germans had encircled the old Russian capital, but Soviet troops still held firm inside the city. With supply lines cut, though, there was no assurance they would last the winter.

Their outbound flight was uneventful. Leningrad was just starting to emerge as a smoky patch on the horizon when Katya gave the order to turn around. Lilya sighed with relief. It was a long haul to Leningrad even under the best conditions, and she couldn’t stop thinking about the forbidding wall of clouds they had seen that morning. They were racing against the elements to get back to the airfield.

Every kilometer seemed tortuously long as they pushed southeast into a crosswind. Then, Natalya spoke. “I see something on the ground! Ten-o-clock…a convoy I think—no! It’s a freight train!” Lilya looked and saw it too—a dark grey snake weaving its way along the frozen ground below. She held her breath.

Several moments passed before Katya replied. “Follow me and engage.”

The squadron banked left and raced down towards the train. Lilya clung to her control stick; her plane rattled and shook as it picked up speed. On either side, her triangular wingtips trembled. The ground loomed up. It was harder than she thought it would be to pull out of the dive; at such high speeds the Yakovlev felt sluggish and unresponsive. Even so, she managed to get several shots on the train as the squadron screamed past, no doubt terrifying the unsuspecting crew within. Although Lilya had heard of flak-cannons being mounted on German trains, this one offered no resistance.

A few more passes, and the train had stopped; filthy black smoke was billowing from the engine, and several freight cars were on fire. Lilya saw no sign of the crew; she hoped they had somehow managed to escape. More anxious than ever, she formed back up on Katya as they set off once more for home and shelter.

It looked like they were flying into the gates of hell. The storm front loomed above them, a heavy grey overcast with lofty white spires that looked like they might reach ten, even fifteen kilometers high. Beneath the clouds, the ground was obscured by heavy snowfall. Lilya felt like her insides were made of lead. The storm was almost upon them, and still there was no sight of the airfield. Lilya looked around frantically for a minute more, and then the storm swallowed them up.

“Stay close, ladies! Stay as close as you can.” It was dark enough in the storm that Lilya could see the formation-lights on Katya’s wings. “We’re just a few kilometers from the airfield now… we’ll enter radio range any minute.”

Lilya did her best to stay calm. At least when you were in a fight, you could do something. All that was left to her now was to keep an eye on the time in her cockpit, and wait.

Navigation in the air was an imperfect art at the best of times. When you could spot landmarks on the ground, it was easy enough to get your bearings, but flying without visibility—flying by instrument—was little more than dead reckoning. In theory, the squadron knew their airspeed and their heading; from which one could calculate how far they had traveled, and in what direction. But strong winds led to a difference between your airspeed (how fast your plane traveled through the air around it) and ground speed (how much ground your plane was actually covering). Inside the storm, Lilya didn’t have a clue which way they should go. She could only hope that Katya had a better sense of direction than she did.

A sharp burst of static came through over the radio. Lilya’s heart jumped—could it be the ground crew? She heard another crackle, and then a man speaking Russian before the wind snatched the signal away. Lilya recognized the deep voice at once. “It’s Sergey! And he’s getting clearer! We must be close!” And then she saw it—like the moon breaking through the clouds, the airfield shimmered into view. The ground crew had lit it up like a Christmas tree; the airfield was ablaze with red, white, and orange.

Lilya slumped with relief. They had made it! And with half an hour of fuel to spare, at that. A moment later Katya was landing, and Lilya followed her down. Up close she saw the runway had been lined with floodlights, flares, and what looked like piles of burning wood. She felt a surge of affection for her crew. Her wheels skidded slightly on the icy ground, but she kept braking steadily—and then it was over. She jumped out of the cockpit and slipped. Sergey was there to help her in an instant. She let him haul her to her feet, then wrapped him up in the strongest bear hug she could muster.

Kaede landed next, followed by Natalya. A sharp crosswind gust caused Esfir’s plane to wobble alarmingly just a few meters off the ground, but she recovered and made it to the ground safely. The only girl left was Eva…

…where was she? The snow was coming down harder now. Lilya had to shield her eyes with a gloved hand as she searched the skies. She should have landed by now… After all, she had been right behind Esfir…

…hadn’t she? Lilya felt sick. When had she last seen Eva? How could this have happened?

Esfir cut her engine. After hours of listening to the rumble of the Yakovlevs, the airfield felt eerily quiet. Lilya strained her ears, but she heard nothing but the wind in the pines, and the flares as they hissed and spat in the snow.

Five minutes passed…then ten. Katya had gone inside—perhaps to talk over the radio—but Lilya and the rest of the squadron remained on the runway. The wind burrowed through her coat, but Lilya didn’t feel cold. Natalya was sobbing; Esfir and Kaede had tears in their eyes even as they tried to comfort the blonde-haired girl. Lilya forced herself not to cry. There was still time; if the storm broke Eva might be able to figure out where she was. Or, she might stumble across the airfield in the snowstorm. Or she’s already—no! Don’t say it!

Twenty minutes passed…then thirty. The flares were beginning to burn out.

At forty-five minutes, Katya ordered the girls inside. Lilya was too numb to refuse. It didn’t matter if the storm cleared now. Eva had already run out of fuel.

It’s over. She isn’t coming back. Even if she bailed out, she’ll die in the snowstorm. She heard the words in her head, and she couldn’t see any way around them, but somehow it hadn’t sunk in. As long as she didn’t acknowledge what happened, maybe it wasn’t true. She didn’t want to think anymore.

It was the middle of the day, but all of a sudden, Lilya felt excruciatingly tired. Wordlessly, she changed out of her ice-covered clothing and stumbled into bed. She pulled the covers over her head and was asleep in seconds.

////

It was nighttime, and Lilya wandered alone through the snow-blanketed forest. A full moon shone brightly overhead as she stumbled between the pines.

“Help!” Lilya heard a voice ahead—Eva’s voice. She took off at a run towards her friend.

“I’m so cold! Where are you?”

“I’m right here!” Lilya gasped. She was trying to shout, but her voice came out in a whisper. She knew Eva couldn’t hear her. She needed to be louder!

“I’m here!” she tried again, but the night swallowed up her voice. She plunged ahead through the snow.

“Please… I’m running out of fuel…” Lilya heard the drone of a plane engine, and saw Eva’s Yak-1 flying overhead. The high-born girl drifted by like a ghost, her plane moving impossibly slow. “Don’t leave me, Lilya.”

“I won’t.” Lilya tried to choke out the words, but before she could, the scene faded to black.

///

Lilya awoke sobbing and clutching her pillow. The dream had felt so real… she could still hear the distant whirring of Eva’s plane in her head. She looked around, trying to ground herself in reality once more. The barracks was dark; Lilya had slept past sunset. The other girls all looked asleep. Cups and a discarded liquor bottle were strewn across the floor.

Lilya took a couple of deep breaths. She felt certain she wouldn’t be able to fall back asleep, but nevertheless laid back down, and closed her eyes.

There it was again… the sound of the plane! Is it really in my head? She sat up, trying to isolate the sound, but it had already vanished. It can’t be real… you know it can’t be…

But Lilya was too far gone to ignore it now. Like a sleepwalker, she drifted to the door and stumbled outside in nothing but her pajamas and stockings.

The cold hit her like a sledgehammer. She gasped in shock, and felt the icy air stab her lungs like needles. Fuck! It must be twenty below. A layer of freshly fallen snow covered the runway, sparkling in the moonlight. Lilya sunk through the powder past her ankles. She was wide awake now, and embarrassed at her own stupidity.

She was about to step back inside when she heard it for a third time. Unmistakably, undeniably, headed right for her—the roar of a plane engine! A thrill raced up her spine.

Over the treetops, the Yakovlev burst into view. The fighter plane swooped low over the runway, kicking up snow in its slipstream, then climbed away and started to circle back around. The slight wobble of the aircraft as it banked, the telltale heaviness on the controls… Lilya recognized it at once. It’s Eva! I know it is! And she can’t land because of the snow! There was no time to ponder the absurdity of the situation. Lilya sprinted back inside and pressed the red button next to the door.

All hell broke loose as air raid sirens wailed across the airfield. Ignoring the shouts and curses from her fellow pilots, she dashed back towards the ground-crew barracks. Sergey was stumbling outside before she even reached the door. He looked at her blearily. “Chto vo imya boga—”

“Clear the fucking runway!” Lilya screamed. She could only imagine what a mess she looked; she was shaking uncontrollably and tears were freezing on her cheeks. “I saw Eva! She’s trying to land!” She looked around frantically in the sky, but the plane was no longer in sight. The sirens were still blaring, and the plane could no longer be heard.

Concern furrowed Sergey’s face. “Lilya, are you sure—” he stopped awkwardly. “I am so sorry about what happened to her.” He moved to embrace Lilya. She shrugged him off as horror flooded through her.

“Please! I know what I saw! You have to believe me, I’m begging you! She’s trying to land!” Her head was starting to spin; she was hyperventilating. “Please,” she gasped.

She felt Sergey’s broad arms wrap around her. “Come, Lilya, we need to get you inside. Some warm blankets and a hot cup of tea, and you’ll feel better.” Lilya struggled feebly against his grip.

“No… I’m telling you… please—”

“Plane spotted! Northeast, headed towards the runway!” The shout came from one of Natalya’s ground crew. He peered above the treeline. “Looks like a Yak-1!”

Sergey released her immediately as he turned back towards the crew. “Get the runway clear right now! And turn on the lights, as well!” The grounds crew poured out of the barracks like ants. Lilya was on the verge of grabbing a snow-shovel when she felt a slender hand on her arm. “Back inside, Litvyak.” It was Katya, a cloak hung unevenly over her shoulders. “You’ve done well, but I’m not going to get Eva back from the dead just to lose you to the cold.”

////

Lilya couldn’t stop shivering; it felt like the cold had burrowed inside her. Esfir had brewed her a cup of tea, but every time Lilya thought she ought to drink it, she couldn’t muster the willpower to raise the cup to her lips. All of her attention was focused outside; on the distant rumble of the Yakovlev that she could still hear indoors. Any minute, she knew, Eva would land, and that thought kept her heart in her throat. Esfir and Natalya were saying something, but their words echoed unnaturally and she couldn’t focus on them.

The roar of the Klimov engine was louder now. It idled for a moment just outside, then sputtered to a halt. Lilya heard shouting. Time was moving impossibly slowly.

There was the sound of footsteps, and then the door flew open with a bang. There she was! Eva looked exhausted, and her normally perfect hair was hopelessly disheveled, but her cheeks were rosy and she had a wild smile on her face. With a scream of delight, Natalya dashed forward and threw her arms around her friend.

For Lilya, the emotions took a little longer to sink in. Her head was still spinning, and she couldn’t shake the feeling that none of this was real. Was Eva really back? Had she ever really left? Maybe I was the one who died out there in the cold. Eva was looking at her with concern, and Lilya tried to speak, but the words wouldn’t come out.

Then Eva was embracing her, and all of her doubts faded away. The warmth from her slender arms, her breath on her cheek: it was as real as anything Lilya had ever felt. “Out on the airfield…there was someone who saw me,’’ Eva whispered. “It was you, wasn’t it.”

“It was.” Lilya could barely speak past the lump in her throat.

“But how did you know I was coming?” Eva was so close that her lips were brushing against her ear.

“I just knew.”

////

After Eva’s dramatic return, going back to bed was out of the question. With a rapidly emptying bottle of top-shelf vodka between them (Natalya’s supply had evidently been replenished), they huddled around their newly-returned comrade as she recounted her adventure.

“Almost as soon as we entered the snowstorm, I lost sight of the squadron. For a few minutes, I was able to stay close by listening to the radio, but then that started to fade out as well. That’s when I knew I was in trouble.”

“Why didn’t you say anything?” Esfir demanded.

Eva shrugged. “I didn’t see the point. If I couldn’t find you in the storm, you couldn’t have found me. It would have been nothing more than a distraction.” Esfir scowled but offered no retort.

“I circled around, looking for any sign of the airfield, but didn’t see anything. I knew I didn’t have much fuel, so I did the only thing I could think of.” Eva smiled her mischievous smile, and took another pull from the bottle. “Ah! I probably shouldn’t drink this much on an empty stomach. But anyways.” She leaned forward for dramatic effect. “I flew south.”

“South!” Natalya exclaimed. “Into the storm?”

“Yes, south. I figured it would be as easy to fly through the storm as it would be to fly back the way we came. And to the south I was more likely to find somewhere to land. Sure enough, by the time I was down to a gallon of fuel, the storm broke.”

“Okay, but this is the part I don’t understand,” said Natalya. “So, you found a place to land, a road or something. How the hell did you refuel? And why did you fly back up in the middle of the night?”

“Well, that was a bit of luck,” said Eva. “I caught sight of a friendly plane—a Lavochkin—and contacted him on the radio. His airfield was very close, so I was able to land and refuel.

“As to why I came back… that’s harder for me to say. Part of it is just that I would be less likely to be intercepted if I came back tonight, as soon as the storm broke. But really…” Eva sniffed and smiled. “I just wanted to be back as soon as I could. I knew that all of you probably thought I was…you know. And I didn’t want you all to worry.” Esfir rolled her eyes, but Lilya could see them glistening in the lamplight.

“So, there you have it. I’m not as smart as you all think I am. I’m nobody’s perfect daughter. But I’m free.

“Za lyubov, ladies. I want to get drunk with you.”

This section picks up where the other left off. NOTE: This section contains (highlight to reveal): consensual BDSM and sex (Idk if that works, but I don't know how to hide spoiler text)

////

There was something in the air; Lilya could almost hear it, taste it on her lips. A sort of golden buzzing, a glow that seemed to leave every illuminated surface tastefully overexposed. Lilya felt good.

The clear weather was holding, and the Moscow radio stations were coming in with a gentle undertone of static. Slow folk music echoed through the room, adding to the atmosphere. Natalya and Esfir were dancing clumsily in the lamplight, Kaede watching them languidly. Lilya was sitting on the floor, and Eva was leaning against her shoulder. Her brown hair was draped across Lilya’s neck. It felt like kiss of an angel.

“I wish you could have seen my home,” Eva murmured. “High vaulted ceilings, woven tapestries. Golden plates, crystal glasses. Servants by each door, waiting on your every word. It felt like a palace because, well, it practically was.” She hesitated for moment. “I couldn’t wait to leave, of course.”

Lilya held as still as she could, lest Eva move her body away. “Why was that, Eva? I know something must have gone wrong… but what?” She thought she knew, but she wanted to hear Eva say it.

Eva was quiet for a long time as the music drifted over them. Lilya could feel her trembling. At last, she spoke.

“My father and I were never close. I knew he loved me, at least in an abstract sense, and I loved him too, but somehow it felt like we were avoiding each other for my entire childhood. Whenever he spoke to me, he always seemed to be telling me off for something I’d done. Or something I hadn’t done. I tried to be a perfect daughter, but it was never good enough for him.

“My father was a very religious man. I studied the bible every day, as far back as I can remember. He had strict views on music, dancing, singing—anything that made people smile was the devil’s work in his eyes.

“He wasn’t a cruel man. But he had so many opinions on who I should be that I never had a chance to figure out who I really was.

“I wasn’t… I don’t know, I wouldn’t say I was unhappy. I had my books, and my mother was very kind to me. But for the last few years, I could feel storm clouds gathering. And a few months ago—just before the war broke out—things came to a head.

“It started off as just another dinner. We had invited another family over; there was a girl named Antonia who I had not met before. She was about my age. We talked for a while, and after dinner I took her to see the library.

“The library was the one part of my home that I truly miss. My father never read much, but the library contained thousands of books that my family had collected for generations. I can still remember the scent of the paper and leather. Tales of myths, adventures, romances—I loved them all. Even the history books, and the atlases. It made for a wonderful escape. From everything.

“Anyways, I took Antonia into the library to show her around. I remember how quiet the library felt, after the constant chatter and bustle of the dining hall. None of the lights were on, so it was darker, too—the sun was going down and it shaded everything pink.”

Eva broke off wistfully. “It makes a bit more sense now. At the time, I just remember feeling… out of sorts. There was something about Antonia that had me on edge. I had this burning desire to impress her, to keep her attention, and I didn’t know why. She was very pretty. When I said something clever, she would smile, and all I wanted to do was to make her smile again.

“I took out one of my favorite books to show her. It was a storybook, actually; full of fairy tales by Alexander Afanasyev. Each page was so beautifully illustrated that you could spend all day looking at it. I sat down next to her in the same armchair to show her. I remember how excited I was to show off such a beautiful work of art. But then, I looked up at her to say something—she was right next to me—and…well… we kissed.

“I couldn’t tell you how long we spent together in that armchair, but the sun was down when I heard the servants starting to clear away dinner. We went back to the great hall and Antonia left with her family.

“That night, my head wouldn’t stop spinning. I felt, guilty, of course—I knew what I had done was a sin. But more than that, I felt alive. For the first time I could remember, I wasn’t fantasizing about being someone else in a storybook world. I wanted to be me. It’s also fair to say that I was hopelessly in love with a girl I had just met. I spent hours thinking up wild schemes of how I could see Antonia again, and what I would do with her when I saw her. I hardly slept that night; but when I woke up in the morning, I didn’t feel tired.

“Everything fell apart as soon as I went downstairs. My father was waiting for me. A servant had seen me with Antonia in the library. My secret was out.”

Tears were running down Eva’s face, but she kept her voice level. “It went about as well as you would expect. He screamed at me, hit me, called me a whore, and said I wasn’t his daughter. The servants just stood there and watched. My mother was nowhere to be seen. In that moment, I hated all of them. I also hated myself.

“I hardly left my bedroom after that. I was consumed by guilt. I didn’t want to read, I didn’t want to eat… I didn’t have the willpower to run away, even if I knew how. It seemed like a waste of effort anyways, since I expected to be thrown out on the street. When war broke out… to be honest, I didn’t care.

“Then, I heard the news from a servant. I was to pack my things and be outside in an hour. I would receive basic instruction on how to fly a plane; then, the military was taking me away. I laughed at the fucked-up irony of it. Every other wealthy man in Russia was pulling strings to make sure his sons didn’t have to serve on the front lines. And here was my father, doing the opposite with his only daughter. He didn’t even say goodbye.

“In a way, that was a kindness. It made the break sharper. I had no home to come back to. I could hate him in peace.

“I promised I would make a new life for myself. Maybe I would survive the war, more likely I would not; but either way, I would spend my days free from sin, and redeem myself in the eyes of God.”

Lilya stirred in surprise.

“But every day I spend at this airfield—with the other girls, with you—I question myself more. It isn’t that I don’t know what I want. I know what I want.

“The question for me is: is it worth it? Is eternal life in the house of the Lord worth it, if I would be living a lie?” Eva broke off with an embarrassed laugh. “What the hell am I talking about. Do you believe in God, Lilya?”

Lilya laughed hoarsely. “Yes. But to be perfectly honest, Eva, I don’t think he gives a damn about any of us. Ever since I saw the soldiers who returned to my hometown—the ones who were injured, the ones who could come back—well, they were good men. They just wanted to be left alone, and the war destroyed them. I will never forget how they looked at me as I walked past them. There is no justice in the world.”

Eva was silent for a long time. “You may be right. This war is senseless and cruel. And it’s hell for everyone caught in the middle of it. But the strangest thing is… I think I like it, Lilya.

“I don’t know what’s wrong with me. But I’ve never felt so alive. I’ve never had a cause before, but I feel like I’d die for any of you.”

Lilya wrapped her arms around her, cradling Eva’s slender body in her lap. Shivers went down her spine at the sensation. “I feel the same way. I’ve never had friends like this before.” Eva looked back at her, eyes gleaming, and before Lilya could stop herself, she kissed her.

Their lips parted after a second, although it could have been closer to a minute for all Lilya could tell. Her whole body was trembling, and there was a rushing sound in her ears. Gravity seemed to have lost all of its pull on her body. That…that was better than flying.

A chorus of cheering greeted her as she looked up. Natalya and Kaede looked taken aback, but all three spectators looked immensely entertained. “Took you long enough,” muttered Esfir. Lilya felt her cheeks flush a novel shade of scarlet. Eva’s cheeks were bright pink as well, and she hastily shifted away. Lilya felt euphoric, but at the same time, confused. What did it mean? Was Eva just drunk? What happened now?

Perhaps it was to cover for Lilya, but at that moment Natalya stood up, none too steadily. “All right, that does it. I want to have some fun.” A nervous silence settled over the squadron—alcohol, it seemed, only strengthened Natalya’s charisma. She picked up a wooden chair from the mess hall and carried it back to the circle, along with what looked like a spool of packaging twine. She leaned over the back of the chair imposingly, her blonde hair framing her face. “I need a volunteer. C’mon, it’ll be fun. Anyone?” Lilya held her breath. She had no idea what Natalya’s intentions were, but there was a very specific part of her that wanted to find out. Her stomach plunged as Natalya caught her gaze. Lilya felt herself falling into those startling green eyes. Natalya smiled teasingly—she knew Lilya couldn’t resist—

But it was Kaede who broke first. The petite girl pushed herself to her feet, smiling nervously. She took one last sip of vodka, then walked unsteadily to the chair, where Natalya was waiting for her with a wicked grin. “Are you going to tell me what I’m in for?” Kaede asked in a quiet voice. Natalya patted her on the cheek. “Oh, I think it will be more fun as a surprise, don’t you? Now, let’s get you comfortable.”

Natalya’s idea of comfort, it seemed, involved almost the entire spool of twine. She used the thin, fibrous rope to bind Kaede’s knees and ankles to opposite chair legs, pulling her thighs apart. She then tied her hands behind her back, looping the twine over Kaede’s wrists again and again to form a sturdy cuff. Finally, she secured the helpless girl’s wrists to the back of the chair. Natalya took a step back to view her handiwork. Kaede, now looking very flustered, was forced to sit up straight in the chair, her shoulders rolled back. She could move her hips slightly, but her arms and legs were almost totally immobilized.

Esfir nodded approvingly. “Not bad, Natalya. What do you have in mind for her?”

“Oh, nothing too severe. But I have an idea that I think Kaede will enjoy.” Once again, Natalya departed for the mess hall, and returned with a large jug of water. “It has been a long night of drinking, hasn’t it ladies? We need to make sure that Kaede stays hydrated.” Kaede’s eyes went wide as realization struck her, and Eva let out a small gasp. But as Natalya approached her bound subject, Kaede tilted her head back, and parted her lips. It took the black-haired girl several minutes to down the entire jug of water, and even before she had finished, she was squirming in her chair. I bet she needed to pee even before all of that water, as much liquor as she drank.

“How are we feeling?” Natalya asked as Kaede’s fidgeting became more pronounced. She ran her slender fingers over Kaede’s body, caressing her arms and legs before rolling up the bottom of Kaede’s shirt. The bulge of her bladder stood out sharply against her toned abdomen. “O, Bozhe—it looks like you’re almost bursting! That looks terribly uncomfortable.” She rested her hand on Kaede’s bulge, eliciting a groan. “I know how badly you need to pee right now…but you can hold it a little longer for me, can’t you?”

“I—a bit longer, yes,” Kaede stammered. Her breathing was heavier now, her chest straining against the front of her shirt. Lilya could now unmistakably see the impressions left by Kaede’s nipples as they hardened against the fabric. Surreptitiously—although it hardly mattered, since all eyes were glued to Kaede—she adjusted her sitting position, resting her right arm across her lap so that the outside of her wrist ground into her pussy. As subtly as she could, she rubbed her wrist back and forth over her clit.

Natalya was in her element. She teased Kaede relentlessly—one moment, caressing her trembling legs; the next, slapping her lightly across the face. “God, you weren’t joking about being turned on by being bullied, were you?” Natalya giggled. “You could cut diamonds with these…” her hands brushed gently over Kaede’s nipples, eliciting another tortured moan.

“Natalya…please, I can’t hold on much longer. Kudasai…”

Natalya laughed. “Oh, you need to take a piss? Well, why didn’t you say so? Here, let me take some of the pressure off…” Ignoring her quarry’s whimpers, she unbuttoned her trousers and worked them as far as she could down Kaede’s legs before the rope got in the way. Lilya—her inhibitions now thoroughly buried by a flood of arousal—feasted her eyes on the sight of Kaede’s delicate mound, just barely hidden by her surprisingly ornate silk panties. Against the pale silk, Lilya could clearly see a dark patch over her pussy.

The stain of wetness did not escape Natalya’s eyes. “What’s going on here, slut? Can’t you control your own body?” She traced two fingers over the outline of Kaede’s soaked labia, causing the helpless girl to buck her hips upwards in search of more sensation. Natalya only tutted. “You’ll be touched when I think you’re ready, and not a second before. That is, if I decide you’re even worth my time…”

A firm smack to her pussy sent Kaede back into her chair with a yelp. With a pressurized hiss, her control over her swollen bladder broke, soaking her panties in an instant. Lilya felt her own pussy spasm as she watched Kaede’s leg and abdominal muscles clench desperately. A second later, Kaede had stemmed the flood, but she was now sitting in a puddle of her own urine.

Natalya seemed impressed. “You don’t give up easy, I’ll give you that, you crazy nymph. I thought you would have let go by now, judging by how much pee you’re holding. Maybe you’ve earned yourself some pleasure after all… maybe. She ran her fingernails absentmindedly over Kaede’s thigh as she thought. “Okay, I have it—here’s the new game. I’m going to give each of the girls a chance to force you to surrender your control, and piss yourself. If you release even one more drop, you lose, and I’m sure I’ll be able to think of a punishment that’s suitably… severe for your failure.” Kaede shuddered, but her eyes were aglow. Lilya’s stomach twisted again. She risked a glance towards her fellow spectators. Eva looked concerned, but no less captivated because of it. Esfir, meanwhile, looked like a wolf that had found its next meal. I don’t like Kaede’s chances…

“If, by some miracle, you survive, I promise it will be worth your while,” Natalya continued. “Sound fair to you, love?”

Kaede groaned as she clenched her legs, trying futilely to bring her thighs together. “Yes, whatever you like! Please, just let me pee soon!”

“Sooner than you think!” Natalya turned to her spellbound audience. “Well? Who’s going first?”

To Lilya’s great surprise, it was Eva who moved first. “I’ll take this dance,” she said coolly. She stood up gracefully, smoothing her nightgown. She walked straight-backed towards her trembling quarry with the composure and command of a queen, her face completely inscrutable. Even Natalya stepped mutely aside as she loomed over a terrified Kaede. “Please, Eva—mercy! Whatever you want, I’ll—” Kaede babbled, her eyes wide with shock. Wordlessly, Eva bent towards her…

…and kissed her on the cheek. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry!” she giggled. “I didn’t mean to scare you so badly; I just wanted to have a bit of fun. Good luck! I hope you make it through. I’m not so sure the other girls will be as nice, though…” Eva turned to Natalya—who looked both exasperated and amused—and gave the blonde girl an apologetic shrug. “Sorry, Natalya dearest, I tried my hardest! But Kaede is unbreakable.”

As Eva returned to her seat, she caught Lilya’s eye.

“Nice work,” Lilya whispered.

“Thanks,” said Eva with a grin. She nodded towards Kaede. “What are you going to do?”

“I don’t know.”

Esfir was the next to take her turn. If Eva had carried herself like a queen, Esfir moved like a hunter. Like Eva, she took a second to stand over Kaede and drink in the view. By now, the mixed-race girl was truly a mess. Her straight black hair was disheveled, and her breath was coming in shallow gasps. True to her word, she hadn’t released any more of her pent-up pee, but her constant squirming had spread the urine in her chair. Her ass and thighs were glistening.

“So many options…” Esfir looked Kaede’s body up and down, ignoring her pleading gaze. “Ah! I know just the thing.” She strode to the mess hall and returned with a slender steel ruler, half a meter long—the kind used as a straight-edge for drawing maps and schematics. Kaede whimpered at the sight. “I wonder how many strokes it will take to break you. I can’t wait to find out…” she dragged the cold metal over Kaede’s bare thighs, causing her to squirm frantically. “Unless you’d rather give in and wet yourself now?” Fear was written on Kaede’s face, but the Sakhalin girl found the courage to shake her head. “Do your worst.”

“I was hoping you’d say that.” Esfir brought the ruler down sharply on Kaede’s thigh. The sound was incredible—a metallic swish, followed by a wet thwack! that sent a ripple through the exposed flesh. Kaede arched her back with a stifled wail. Seconds later, a strip of pink blossomed where the ruler had struck.

Esfir didn’t give her long to recover. She rained a flurry of strokes down on both of her thighs, each one sharper than the last.

Thwack! Thwack! Thwack! Lilya winced with every strike.

Each time the ruler landed, Kaede quivered and moaned a sharp haa! of pain. Somehow, though, she held her bladder—although Lilya suspected she might be leaking into her panties in a rather different manner. Her cheeks were flushed, and her breathing was heavy.

“All right, that’s enough!” Natalya announced. Ruefully, Esfir lowered her ruler and inspected the damage she’d inflicted. “Well, those thighs are a pretty sight, at least.” Lilya had to agree—Kaede’s perfect skin was now crisscrossed with stripes of red and pink. “You have heart,” Esfir said after a moment. “To tell you the truth, I wasn’t sure about you when we met. But you’ve earned my respect.” Gently, she brushed back Kaede’s disheveled hair and, like Eva before her, kissed Kaede on the cheek before returning to her seat.

All eyes turned now to Lilya. She pushed herself hesitantly to her feet. I still don’t know what to do. Kaede was very clearly on the brink now—squirming constantly, bucking her hips helplessly in the air—the lightest touch might be enough to push her bladder over the edge. Could I really do that? Force her to humiliate herself in front of the entire squadron? The thought was enough to send another thrill up her spine. She wondered what Eva would think. Then again… wasn’t it Kaede who really mattered here? What did she want?

She moved towards Kaede in a trance, an angel on one shoulder, a devil on the other.

////

Kaede looked up at her; eyes questioning, chest heaving. From this angle, Lilya could see just how swollen her bladder was—it bulged out sharply over her panties, hard as a rock. Every muscle in her abdomen and legs was straining. One way or another, this has to end. She can’t bear much more of this. Lilya breathed in deeply. The scent of urine, mixed with the deeper aroma of sex, washed away her inhibition. She was ready.

Kaede’s nipples were still erect, betraying themselves as two tiny peaks in the middle of her small, firm breasts. With a trembling hand, Lilya reached towards Kaede’s chest. She heard a faint gasp of surprise as Kaede realized her intention, but the captive girl made no effort to avoid her touch.

Lilya could hear the blood pounding in her ears. She’d never touched a woman before, not like this. She cupped one breast in her hand, then the other, gently squeezing the tender flesh. She rubbed Kaede’s nipples with her palm. Kaede threw her head back, releasing another tortured moan. Her nipples were now painfully hard, straining against the fabric. For a moment, Lilya toyed with the idea of unbuttoning Kaede’s shirt. But as enticing as the idea of touching her bare breasts was, it somehow felt out of line. Besides, there was no need.

Quickly, before Kaede could prepare herself, Lilya seized both of her nipples between her thumbs and forefingers and pinched them. Hard.

The effect was instantaneous. Kaede yelped in pain, shock written all over her face. A burst of urine soaked the front of her panties and splattered onto the floor. She arched her back, fists clenched. “No!” Somehow, she once again managed to regain control of her bladder and stem the flood of piss. But the damage was done—the game was lost.

Kaede slumped back into her chair, her expression somewhere between dismay and rapture. The red flush on her cheeks had spread down, across her neck and the exposed skin of her upper chest.

For her part, it was all Lilya could do not to slide a hand inside her panties and rub herself right there. She’d really done it—Kaede had wet herself right in front of her! Lilya squeezed her thighs together, reveling in the sensation as more of her juices leaked into her panties. Natalya, Eva and Esfir seemed momentarily dumbstruck.

It was Natalya who spoke first. “Hell, I don’t think anything is going to top that. I think that’s where we should leave it for tonight—unless any of you want to explain to Katya why we should get the morning off tomorrow. I’ll suspend your punishment for now, Kaede, but don’t think I’ve forgotten. I’ll think of something suitable; don’t you fret.”

Kaede winced, and looked up at Lilya. “Can you help me with…?” she nodded towards her bound legs. “I, ah, I still really have to go.”

Lilya felt a rush of compassion for her comrade. “Of course, Kaede.” As the other girls retired to their beds, Lilya bent to her task.

Untying Kaede’s ankles was harder than Lilya had imagined—Natalya’s handiwork seemed suspiciously well-practiced. Making matters more difficult, the lamp had been put out and the other girls were in bed, forcing Lilya to rely on the moonlight pouring through the small barracks windows. It also didn’t help that Lilya’s hands wouldn’t stop trembling. She was still extremely turned on; focusing on the knots of twine took all of her willpower. From the slight whimper in Kaede’s breathing, the petite girl was still very desperate to pee. After the humiliation she endured at my hands, the least I can do is get her to the showers before she lets go completely.

At last, she freed Kaede’s ankles and turned to her bound wrists, which were still secured to the back of the chair. Once again, it was slow going; Kaede had pulled the knots tight with her futile struggling. “Lilya… please hurry,” Kaede whispered. Her legs were double-crossed in her chair, and she was fidgeting badly. “I’m trying, I’m trying,” muttered Lilya. “Keep still, please! You’re pulling the knots tighter.” With a frustrated whimper, Kaede tried to stay her trembling muscles.

At last, the rope that held Kaede’s wrists to her chair fell away. Kaede staggered to her feet, her hands still tied behind her back. Unable to pull up her trousers, she opted instead to kick them to the floor. “Ah! It’s so much worse when I stand up!” She took one teetering step towards the showers, then another, grunting with exertion. Perspiration glinted silver on her face in the faint light. “Huhh—I’m not going to make it!” She doubled over, clenching her legs as hard as she could.

“Yes, you are!” Lilya wrapped one arm behind her legs and the other behind her back. Before Kaede could object, she picked her up and carried her to the showers.

Lilya could feel Kaede’s heart hammering as she held her close. A couple drops of urine dripped down onto Lilya’s legs—Kaede was starting to leak again. “Sorry, sorry!” Kaede whined helplessly.

“Almost there!” Lilya whispered in reply. Kaede’s breaths were coming in anguished gasps. Lilya took a few more steps, then passed through the entranceway to the showers.

She set Kaede down with a groan of relief. Unable to support herself, Kaede fell onto her side, curled up with her hands still tied behind her back. Lilya bent towards her. “We made it! Now let me help you with…”

But it was too late—Kaede had already let go. With a moan of pure bliss, her body relaxed and urine started to gush from her tortured bladder. Rivulets of pee poured down her legs into the waiting shower drain. “Ahhh…. Ah…. Ah….” Kaede sighed in relief as her bladder rapidly emptied.

It was all too much for Lilya. She had spent the whole night spiraling into deeper and deeper levels of arousal, unable to relieve herself with all the other girls watching. But now, in the faint moonlight, with Kaede wetting herself at her feet, her inhibitions broke. I just need a few seconds… I’m already so close to the edge! She slipped a hand into her panties and began frantically rubbing her clit. 

Kaede would look up any second; there was no time for nuance. She just needed to come, and come quickly. Or Kaede will know what a deviant slut I am. With that dirty fantasy painted vividly in her mind, she felt her legs and stomach begin to tingle and burn—more powerfully than she’d ever felt before. Lilya panicked. I can’t make any sound or she’s going to know…fuck. Fuck! She bit the fabric of her shirt in desperation. She came hard, juices coating her already soaked fingers. Her legs spasmed and then buckled, and despite her best efforts she uttered a strangled “mmmph!” as she fell to her knees.

Kaede looked up. Realization flashed across her angled face, and she glanced away.

Lilya, quickly coming back down to earth, wanted to curl up and die.

After several seconds of excruciating silence, Kaede spoke. Her voice was unnaturally light and shaky. “S-some, some night, huh?”

Lilya managed a weak chuckle. “Yeah. Some night.”

Another pause. “Lilya, it’s wrong of me to ask, but…d-do you … do you think you could?” She nodded towards her waist.

“Oh, of course! I’m so sorry, I forgot about that,” Lilya stammered. She quickly moved to untie Kaede’s hands, which were still secured behind her back. But to her surprise, Kaede shook her head and moved her hands away. “No, I meant… ah! Do you think you could…” Kaede swallowed. “Could you touch me? Please?”

For what felt like the hundredth time that night, Lilya was completely dumbstruck. She tried to formulate a reply, but her brain seemed to have shut off completely. She had only just begun to consider the possibility that she liked women in that sort of way, and this seemed like a daunting escalation. She had taken her turn on Kaede with the other girls, yes, but that was different; a bit of fun, nothing over the line. She’d never even really laid hands on her, skin to skin.

And then, of course, there was Eva. She would understand. Wouldn’t she? Guilt stabbed at her stomach.

She focused instead on Kaede—eyes wide and staring, face red with shame, legs slick with her own urine—and made up her mind. Kaede was loyal and kind. She had been through a lot tonight—certainly more than Lilya could have endured—for the entertainment of her comrades. A reward at her hands seemed like the least Lilya could offer. “Of course,” she said.

The look of gratitude on Kaede’s face made Lilya confident she was doing the right thing. The bound girl rolled onto her back; legs spread invitingly. Very gently, Lilya reached out and brushed her thumb across Kaede’s mound, reveling in the texture of the wet silk. Her body feels like it’s on fire. Kaede arched her hips, seeking greater contact. Lilya brought her hand closer, using two fingers to trace her labia while her middle finger ran between them. The wet silk gave way easily beneath her fingers, pressing into the Kaede’s slit. Lilya continued upwards and started to rub gently against the small nub that she hoped was Kaede’s clit, eliciting a moan of pleasure.

Lilya hesitated. She’d gotten this far on instinct, but she was acutely aware that she had no idea what she was doing. Her hands felt clumsy and inexperienced, and the dim light added to her confusion. Doubt started to creep in on her. What if I can’t get her off? I wish we’d spent a few hours learning about this in training, instead of studying flight manuals.

Then, she had an idea. She pulled Kaede back up to a seated position, then sat behind her so her legs wrapped around Kaede’s waist. She’d never been so close to a woman—or anyone—before. Kaede’s wet thighs pressed against her own. Lilya nestled her chin between Kaede’s neck and shoulder, inhaling a scent of urine, sex, and what might have been perfume. Unable to resist, she gently bit the tender skin of Kaede’s neck, and was rewarded with a gasp of surprise.

Then, with all the confidence she could muster, she reached her hand under the bottom of Kaede’s shirt, resting it against her flat stomach. She took a moment to savor the feeling of the abdominal muscles under her fingers. With Kaede’s every breath, she felt them harden under her fingers. Ever so slowly, she guided her hand lower and lower. Her fingertips glided under Kaede’s panties.

A second later, her hand was cupping Kaede’s pussy. Panicked thoughts darted through her head, but she blocked them out by closing her eyes, and focusing only on what she could touch and feel. The heat of Kaede’s sex against her palm was intense. Her panties were soaking wet, but the moisture oozing from Kaede’s slit was thicker and stickier—an unmistakable invitation. Lilya pushed one finger inside. Kaede moaned.

Gently, Lilya began working her finger in and out, curling her finger upwards the way she always did when she touched herself. The motion was familiar enough to be disorienting; without being touched, her own pussy twitched helplessly.

Lilya continued her work for several minutes. Then, Kaede’s moans became more urgent, and Lilya knew that she had her. Her confidence grew. She picked up her pace, producing a sodden shlick with every thrust. Kaede arched her back, her moans turning into whines. Her legs clenched and unclenched as she started to lose control. Lilya reached around with her other hand and rubbed firmly against Kaede’s clit. “Come for me,” she whispered in her ear.

“Haahh!” Kaede bent double as she climaxed, falling back into Lilya’s arms. Her whole body was trembling. She started giggling, and Lilya joined in, only to stop a moment later when she realized Kaede was in fact sobbing uncontrollably.

“It’s okay! I’m okay.” Kaede took several deep breaths. She looked back at Lilya, tears glistening in the moonlight but a smile on her face. “I’m sorry. It was just… so much.”

“I understand.” Lilya took the opportunity to finally untie Kaede’s hands. When she was done, Kaede turned around so that she was kneeling, facing Lilya. She put a hand on Lilya’s thigh. “Would you like me to…?” It took Lilya several seconds to process what she meant, and she felt her cheeks go red when she had. “Oh!” Part of her wanted very much to know what Kaede had in mind, but the rest of her felt physically and mentally exhausted. “Thank you, Kaede. But I feel like I’m about to collapse.”

Kaede nodded understandingly. “I know what you mean. But before I go to bed I really need to rinse off!” She laughed self-consciously. She stepped under a faucet and started to unbutton her shirt. Then, she stopped, looking up questioningly.

Lilya saw her cue to leave. “Good night, Kaede.”

“Good night. And, thank you. For everything.”

A moment later, Lilya was in bed in a fresh change of clothes. The alcohol was beginning to wear off, and she could already feel a faint headache above her eyes. What a night…

She was about to drift off when a sound snapped her wide awake. She sat up and looked to her left. It was Eva. She was curled up in her bed, crying.

*024*2024-05-20 03:00

Haha glad you all liked it. Yeah she was a real person. So was Katya Budanova - to this day they remain the only female aces (5+ aerial kills) in history. The other four are completely fictional.

Got only a shorter segment ready this week - I've been traveling all week for work and didn't get back until late last night. Stay tuned though, I have a fun segment ready for next time!

//// October 8, 1941

Lilya flew southwest at five thousand meters. Over her left shoulder, she could see Katya, and the four other ladies of the squadron behind her. She was lost in thought.

The week since Eva’s return had been marked by a fragile return to normalcy. Just as before, the squadron ran two, sometimes three, sorties behind enemy lines; collecting recon and making the occasional strafing run against unsuspecting German positions. There was no denying, however, that the distance to the front lines was getting shorter and shorter. In some places, the enemy had pushed within fifty kilometers from the airfield. Once or twice, late at night on the edge of sleep, Lilya had thought she’d heard the sound of artillery.

Lilya checked the formation. All five pilots were in position, angled back from their leader at a forty-five degree angle, each just a few meters higher in altitude than the plane in front of them. The weather was clear, and Lilya could see all the way to the horizon. Ahead, she could make out several columns of smoke.

“Shall we begin our descent?” Lilya’s stomach twinged as Eva’s voice, composed as ever, cut through her headset. Since the night they had kissed, Eva hadn’t spoken an unneeded word to Lilya.

Lilya knew she couldn’t fault her. In the showers with Kaede, the right thing had felt obvious; now, she wasn’t sure. But either way, it had been naive to assume Eva would not be upset by what she and Kaede had done. There were some moments where she blamed Eva for being unfair—after all, it wasn’t as if the two of them were a couple—and other moments where she blamed Kaede for tempting her. Most of the time, though, she blamed herself.

Lilya checked the landscape below. “One more minute.” With nearly a hundred sorties under her belt, she had become adept at identifying landmarks within the flight radius of the airbase. Leading the squadron, however, was a first.

The night before, Katya had summoned her to her quarters after dinner. Ignoring the curious looks from the other girls, Lilya had followed her commanding officer to her room, closing the door behind her.

It was Lilya’s first look at the space where Katya spent most of her time while not in the air. The furnishings were spartan: a small bed and dresser filled most of one side of the room, while a chair and writing desk occupied the other. An old-fashioned oil lamp glowed steadily, bathing the room with a warm yellow light. Next to the lamp on the desk was a radio, with a wire antenna that ran up the wall behind it to the roof. It was turned on at a low volume—Lilya could just make out the faint sound of static. There were several papers spread across the desk—some stamped and official-looking, others handwritten—but otherwise, every object in the room looked perfectly in place. Despite its austerity, Lilya found the room to be strangely comforting. It reminded her of home, she realized.

Katya began to speak. “Before I get to my main point of business, I have a question for you.” Her eyes narrowed, boring into Lilya’s. “These last few weeks, something seems to be bothering you. As your commanding officer, is it anything I should know about?”

Lilya swallowed. “No, ma’am.”

Katya sighed with what might have been exasperation, but her gaze softened. “What about as someone who cares about you, and your well-being?”

This caught Lilya off-guard. “I, uh…”

Katya shook her head ruefully. “I’m sorry. This is my fault. Let me explain.

“When you become an officer, you realize an uncomfortable truth. Authority isn’t as simple as wearing a chevron on your uniform. It’s about perception. It’s about the perception of confidence. Of superiority.

“I used to be a private like you. When I was promoted, I tried to go along as though nothing had changed. I had my friends in the military—my fellow pilots from the same squadron—and they were happy for me when I received my promotion, even though it meant that I would be giving them orders. That meant the world to me. You see, I didn’t want anything to change.” She looked over her shoulder, to the piles of documents on her desk. “I just wanted to fly. I didn’t want any of this.

“But I soon found that my friendships had turned into a liability. Every time a made a decision that favored one pilot over another, I had to stop and ask myself, would this make any of my friends upset? New members of my squadron resented the fact that I would socialize with my old comrades, but not them. In short, my first stint as a Lieutenant quickly devolved into a politicized mess, with my every decision upsetting somebody on a personal level.

“That was one of the first lessons I learned. In order to give commands to someone, you cannot treat them as an equal. As a woman, this is doubly true. You must conduct yourself as their superior.

“It was one of the hardest decisions I ever made. At first, my friends did not understand, and they were hurt. But before long, we had re-established our rapport, albeit more formally than before. I had as much affection for them as ever, but I had to create distance. It’s a difficult line to walk. You have to act as though you don’t care, even when you do.

“And so I ask you again, Lilya. Is everything all right?”

“I…” Lilya was still struggling for a response. She knew that Katya had just revealed something meaningful—something private—but she was unsure how much of her dilemma she could share. “Eva and I had a disagreement. I think that she’s still upset with me.”

Katya’s face was inscrutable as she nodded. “I thought as much. Well, as I said, the battlefront is a difficult place for friendships. I am sure that once some more time has passed, the two of you will come to an understanding.”

Katya’s words did little to reassure Lilya. I don’t want an “understanding.”

“In any case, that isn’t why I wanted to speak with you. Effective immediately, I’m promoting you to Efréĭtor.”

Lilya inhaled sharply. “Ma’am?”

“You have shown swift progress, not only in your flying ability, but in your knowledge of aviation strategy. There is more to staying alive than aerial finesse. Most engagements you will find yourself in are won or lost before the first bullets are fired. Positioning and timing are more important than dogfighting.

“I hope you understand what this promotion means. Should I be killed or otherwise taken out of action, you will assume command of the unit as the highest-ranking member of the squadron.”

It was a deeply unsettling thought. Why not Natalya? she wanted to ask. “Yes, ma’am.”

“With this in mind, I want you to lead the squadron tomorrow. You will give commands with my authority. I have no intention of leaving my post. But, should something happen, I need you to be ready. Dismissed, Efréĭtor Litvyak.”

With Katya’s words echoing in her head, she scoured the horizon, looking for any scrap of information that might affect the mission. Positioning and timing are more important than dogfighting. She spotted a new column of smoke blossoming almost straight ahead, well behind the German lines. She though quickly. There was no sign of AA fire near the explosion, which meant it had been caused by either an accident, landmine, or a lucky Soviet artillery strike. In either case, where there was one fuel truck or field-depot, there was likely to be more. The target was well off their intended route, but so what? The mission was to destroy enemy equipment however they could. “Change course. New heading, two six zero.” She tried to imitate Katya’s cool, authoritative style.

She adjusted her trajectory, and breathed a sigh of relief when Katya and the rest of the squadron followed without objection. She led them down towards the plume of smoke. She squinted, trying to make out what was burning. “Esfir, can you see what’s on fire?”

“Not yet.”

“Understood.” Lilya continued to lead them lower. She drummed her fingers restlessly against the control stick. At this moment, the squadron was extremely vulnerable. If they were detected—

“Bandits! High, 3 o’clock! Fighters!” Katya shouted over the radio.

Lilya looked with horror to her right. A formation of Messerschmitt 109s was diving on them. At least six, maybe more—she didn’t have time to count. “Break!” Lilya screamed, but the Soviet formation had already scattered. A moment later, the Germans were upon them.

Phosphorous tracer rounds rained past Lilya like hail; a 109 was behind her and closing fast. She flicked her plane upside-down and pulled back hard on the stick, attempting to complete a half-loop that would send her back in the opposite direction. She groaned as the g-forces hit her. She’d never attempted such a tight loop; there was no way the 109 could follow her at even higher speeds. Her vision started to turn grey, but she didn’t let up; the forest below was getting frighteningly close. Come on… breathe! She pulled out of the dive just a few hundred feet above the treeline. Gasping for air, she looked around frantically for her opponent. She was aware that several people were shouting over the radio, but couldn’t process a word they were saying.

Then she saw him—rather than follow Lilya through her split-S, the 109 had looped upwards instead of downwards and was now diving straight down at her. He opened fire.

There was no time to think. Lilya banked 90 degrees and broke right, pulling as hard as she could, ignoring the metallic shriek of protest from her airframe. Shells zipped past her, but the maneuver minimized her plane’s profile from above, and none of the rounds found their mark. With a shoom, the 109 overshot her. She pressed through her turn with gritted teeth, trying to end up behind him when he pulled out of his dive.

But there was no need. Perhaps the pilot reacted too slowly, or perhaps the dive had been too steep. As Lilya brought her plane around, she saw the 109 plow into the forest in front of her. The wreckage immediately burst into flame.

Lilya yanked her gaze away. Panicked shouts were still coming though over the radio—her squadron needed her. She turned around quickly and headed back into the fight.

The dogfight had turned into a proper furball—the fighter planes swarmed above the treetops like hornets. Two fires were burning fiercely on the ground, but Lilya didn’t know whose side they belonged to.

By now, the Germans’ twin advantages of altitude and surprise had been spent. With their slight edge in maneuverability, Lilya knew the Yakovlevs should have the advantage in a tight engagement like this. Still, with so many planes flying past each other, anything could happen.

Lilya locked in on one German pilot. He was bringing his plane over in a vertical loop, which the pursuing Yak-1 struggled to emulate. The Russian plane broke off awkwardly, on the edge of stalling. In a few seconds, the 109 would complete his loop and get a clean shot, but Lilya was closing fast. She took a steadying breath and lined up the 109 in her gunsights. Now! She let off a one-second burst from both her cannon and machinegun.

With little speed, the 109 was a helpless target. Lilya saw strikes all along the fuselage, and debris flew off the plane. At once, it stopped turning and broke off in a straight line. For a second, Lilya thought the pilot might be making an escape. But rather than maintain a level flight, the 109 listed to the left, then rolled over and began spinning uncontrollably. A moment later, the plane crashed into the ground, scoring Lilya her second kill in as many minutes.

The Germans had had enough. The remaining four planes dove away from the fight and ran west at treetop level. Lilya gave the command not to pursue further into enemy territory. They had pushed their luck enough as it was.

With the fight over, Lilya quickly counted up the Yaks around her. One, two, three, four… five! She gave a choked sob of relief. One of the Yaks looked to be leaking coolant, and Esfir remarked with casual surprise that her arm was bleeding, but they had all made it. Katya had scored a kill, as had Esfir. The radio was now filled with the usual giddy post-fight banter, but Lilya felt unable to join in. It was one thing to risk your own life, she realized, and quite another to risk the lives of your friends.

Lilya’s reflective mood held until after they landed and Katya approached her. “To my quarters,” the Lieutenant said, as inscrutable as ever. Lilya followed her, a dull ache in her stomach.

With the door closed behind them, Katya’s demeanor softened. From a desk drawer she produced a glass liquor bottle. She took a long swig, then handed the bottle to Lilya. “Here. You look like you need a drink. Sorry I don’t have any glasses.” Lilya took a couple swallows of the fiery liquid—which was not vodka, as she had expected—and felt warmth spread through her core. “That’s Scotch whisky,” Katya said, pre-empting Lilya’s question. “Got it from an old friend.”

“I know things didn’t go as planned today, but in all honesty, I thought you did well in your first day of command. It was unfortunate that they caught us by surprise, and perhaps we could have been more vigilant, but I agreed with your decision to investigate the fire. As for the fight itself, well…” Katya paused. “Congratulations on your first—and second—kills. If you keep following your instincts, I’m sure you have many more to come.”

“Thank you, Lieutenant.” Lilya tried to smile. But instead, inexplicably, she burst into tears.

Lilya felt terribly embarrassed as she tried to pull herself back together. Katya, however, seemed unconcerned, and waited patiently as Lilya recomposed herself. After a moment, the swell of emotion passed, and Lilya took a couple of deep breaths. “I’m sorry. I’m just… it’s not that I’m afraid for myself. I mean, I am, but more than that, I’m just scared that one of my friends is going to die. And that it will be my fault.”

Lilya saw a deep sadness in Katya’s eyes. “Here is a hard truth of command, Lilya. My job—and yours, some day—is not to get your squadron home. We might say it, but it isn’t true. Your job is to aid in the defense of the Soviet Union by any means you can, with the authority assigned to you.”

Lilya left Katya’s office feeling dazed, but oddly comforted. Perhaps it had simply been the alcohol and words of praise, but the knot of anxiety in her stomach had eased. It was a matter of perspective, she supposed. In war there was no way to ensure her squadron’s safety. But she could always strive to act in the best interest of the People’s Republic.

When she returned to the mess hall, she saw the other girls already lounged there, drinking tea. That was usually how it went; there was the giddy high right after a fight, and then the crash as the adrenaline faded. Moving could be a struggle; the thought of suiting back up for another sortie excruciating. All the same, the other girls greeted Lilya with warm smiles and murmured praise. As if waking from slumber, Eva slowly set down her cup and stood up. “Do you have a moment, Lilya? I’d like to talk to you.” Lilya nodded and followed Eva to her bunk.

Eva had a determined look on her face, and Lilya knew she was steeling herself to say something difficult. After a moment, she found her voice. “I thought you did well today,” Eva began.

“Thank you.”

“You know… you saved my life back there. I stalled my plane with the German right above me. You shot him down before he could dive on me.”

“I didn’t realize it was you. But I remember.”

“Thank you,” Eva said. Lilya waited.

After a moment, Eva spoke again. “I wanted to say sorry. This past week, I haven’t been fair to you. The night that I came back, I thought it meant something more than it did. And afterwards, seeing you with Kaede… I suppose it made me jealous. But we never made any promises. I had no right to be upset with you.”

“Yes, you did,” Lilya replied in a choked voice. “I didn’t think about your feelings.

“I really like you Eva, and I do have feelings for you. But I can’t pretend that I’m not attracted to Kaede as well. That night… I think I tried to convince myself that I was being kind to her, nothing more. But that isn’t true, and it isn’t fair to any of us to pretend it is. I’m just really confused right now.” Lilya released something between a laugh and a sob. “All of these feelings are so new to me. For you at least, you knew before you got here that you liked girls. I have to come to terms with that while also trying not to get killed by the Nazis every day.” Eva smiled, and before she could stop herself, Lilya threw her arms around her.

Eva returned her embrace with a relieved laugh. “I’m just glad we can still be friends,” she said.

“Me too!” Lilya exclaimed. “And really, I am sorry for what I did. I’ll find a way to make it up to you. Apart from saving your life, I mean.”

“That was a pretty good start. But I’m sure I’ll think of something else.”
