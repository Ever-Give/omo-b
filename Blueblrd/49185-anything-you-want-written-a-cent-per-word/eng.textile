Hullo! My name is Brianna and I am a college student hoping to buy a bit of extra food by outsourcing to freelancing! I am an incredible writer and have been writing since I was 12, fanfiction, mini-books, plot-lines, and even Resumes, along with the occasional housing as on craigslist. I can write fiction, sci-fi, and romance stories, or straight up Erotica about pretty much any kink you can think of! I want to make sure you get a good quality piece of writing at little cost to you, after all, if you only need 100 words written that is just a dollar! Simple enough for you, and a whole cup of Ramen for the starving student!

I will ask that you pay me before I start writing as I cannot waste my time on clients that are not willing to pay, if you are uncomfortable with that, someone else with most likely higher rates could be a better choice for you.

I can provide examples of all forms of my writing before payment is reached and I accept Paypal, no checks, please.

You can contact me the easiest through Discord [Removed] or my email [Removed]
