Hey everyone. This is just a short story I wrote up on my phone today while I myself was relaxing on the beach. Hope you all enjoy.

*****

"Hey Izzy, can we go soon? I kinda gotta pee," Penelope said, crossing her legs on the large towel that the two women were laying on.

It was late in the afternoon at the Jersey shore, at a lesser-populated section of beach that stretched in front of a large residential area. Near Seaside and the pier, you couldn't walk two feet without bumping into anyone. Here, while there were people around, they were more spread out in clusters with their friends or family.

"I gotta go too," Isabel muttered. "We really just got here though, and it's a long walk back. Let's just do it in the ocean."

"We can't go in the water, there's no lifeguard here," Penelope stated. "I think they left at five."

"Like that matters, we're only going in up to the vag and it's a super calm day. C'mon, I gotta go."

Penelope and Isabel were vacationing here from Pennsylvania, staying at a summer rental for three weeks. Their parents had fucked off to Atlantic City, but they were nineteen and twenty, so rather than sit around the lobby of a casino with nothing to do aside from peck on questionable sushi, they elected to stay in the area, go shopping, and eventually hit the beach.

They stood up together and placed their heavy cooler and purses on the towel to stop it from blowing away. They had only been at the beach for an hour, but the two of them had gone through plenty of water and more than a couple of wine coolers each. Yes, they weren't of legal drinking age, but their parents were Spaniards and cared little for the more ridiculous American laws, unlike the casinos.

Isabel yelped and jumped as a cool wave surrounded her ankles, and Penelope followed her in. They waded until the waterline was around their hips, gasping periodically as small waves splashed them when they weren't ready for it.

"Alright, we're good here," Penelope muttered. She closed her eyes and tried to relax her bladder. It took a moment, but her muscles calmed down and she was just about to start peeing when Isabel slapped her lightly on the arm.

"Penny, look..."

Penelope opened her eyes. Isabel tilted her head towards the shore. Penelope turned her gaze, and immediately noticed that more than half the people on the beach were staring straight at them. Not only were they the only people in the water for miles, but they were two young, athletic Spanish women wearing nothing but matching red bikinis. They were certainly first in line for the title of 'Center of Attention.'

"I can't pee like this," Isabel whispered with a nervous giggle. She couldn't be heard over the wind and waves, but her mouth movement combined with sibling telepathy was more than enough for Penelope.

"I mean...we're just standing here, they probably already think that's what we're doing. Might as well actually do it," Penelope offered. "And this was your idea in the first place."

"It just won't come out," Isabel whined, bouncing slightly in the water."

"Fuck, I can't do it either now," Penelope sighed. "Let's get out of here before a patrol guy comes past and tells us off for going in the ocean without a lifeguard."

The two women trudged out of the ocean and back to their towel. "We have to go back to the rental," Isabel muttered. "Come on, load up the stuff."

"I don't wanna walk that far when I need to pee this bad," Penelope complained. "It already hurts, let alone when I'm moving and after that much time."

"It's really that bad?" Isabel asked her sister.

The younger woman nodded, her legs held tightly together. "I didn't wanna leave too soon but I've been pretty desperate for a while."

"It's getting there for me too I guess," Isabel sighed. "I guess we should wait till we have to go even worse, then it'll be easier to pee in the ocean."

"Fine," Penelope conceded. "Shouldn't be long. Here, let's drink something else, make it even quicker." She opened the cooler and tossed a water bottle to Isabel, then took one for herself. They sat on the towel and quickly drank their bottles, placed the empties back in the cooler, and laid down on the towel.

Twenty minutes passed. Isabel and Penelope were both squirming in place while playing with their phones, trying to stay subtle but failing more and more as time flowed on. "I have a pee belly," Penelope moaned suddenly.

Isabel turned her head. Her sister had her right hand on her stomach, which was protruding visibly. "Damn, that's a lot of whiz," she giggled. "Think you're ready for the ocean? I'm kinda bursting here."

"Yeah, let's try again." They both stood up once more, but this time the motion caused their bladders to throb powerfully and suddenly. They yelped and moved to hold themselves, only stopping once they realized that a pervert or two may still have eyes on them. "Hurryhurryhurry..."

They shoved their phones back in their purses and weighed down the towel again, then waddled to the water's edge. A minute later, they were waist-deep once more.

"Holy shit, I need to pee so bad," Penelope cried.

"Do it," Isabel told her.

"I'M TRYING!"

Isabel reached her hand over and shoved Penelope's stomach. She shrieked and stepped back, nearly falling over into the water. "Stop, people might seeeee," she finished with an extended whine.

"I'm gonna squeeze it out of you if you don't pee right now," Isabel threatened.

"Well, are you peeing?" Penelope countered.

"....No."

"Then shut up."

"I don't get it, we're both so desperate, why can't we do it?"

Penelope groaned, bending slightly below the surface and finally holding herself. "We've never gone with people looking at us. Even if they can't really SEE, it's still super weird."

"Well I can't hold it until we get back to the rental at this point. I'll really wet myself," Isabel mumbled, her face growing very worried.

"Me too," Penelope responded, empathy in her voice.

"What are we gonna do?"

"Well, let's get out of the water, obviously this isn't going to fucking work."

Still totally unrelieved, they shambled out of the surf once more, fighting hard not to appear as frantic as they really were. They made it back to their towel, but neither one laid back down.

"SO WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?" Isabel repeated loudly, her voice cracking slightly.

"Sssshhhhh," Penelope hissed. She looked around, not sure what for, but her eyes found it anyway. "Look. There."

Isabel turned and saw it. The lifeguard chair, tilted on its back as it always was when unoccupied, facing away from the ocean a few dozen meters away from them. "What about it?"

"The chair is cover from this side," Penelope explained. "The dunes are cover from the other side. If we go behind there we should just be able to pull our bikinis aside and pee in the sand under the chair with nobody seeing us."

Isabel blinked at the chair. "What...what if people come over the dunes? The chair's right in front of a walkway."

"It's later in the afternoon. More than half the people who were here when we got here have left. I don't think anyone else will show up."

"Okay...we can try."

Without wasting one second, the women made a beeline for the tipped chair. They struggled to walk on the soft, dry sand, the already unstable ground made ten times worse by their bursting bladders. Finally they made it to the top of the incline, however a huge problem was made clear to both of them at the same time.

"Ah, fuck," they whispered in unison. While not visible from the water's edge, the second stories of the homes that lined the boardwalk were now looming over them. Anyone looking out of one of their windows would have a full view of them.

"Penny, I can't hold it," Isabel cried. She sounded completely defeated. "I'm gonna pee right here, I can't wait anymore..."

"Come on," Penelope encouraged her. "I've had to go longer than you have, and what if someone really is looking? What if you start peeing and they start filming? You wanna end up on a voyeur pee porn site?"

"The fuck? Is that a thing?"

"Everything is a thing on the internet. Either way, it can't happen. We have to figure something else out," Penelope groaned.

"Maybe we just sit on the sand and frickin' pee," Isabel suggested.

"We could, but then we'd have to lay in it until it dries or people would see the marks when we stand up."

"Ewww... Can we just pee in the towel? Stuff it in a bag, go to the laundromat?"

Penelope pursed her lips. "Hey...that would work. That's the one! Come on!"

"I can barely walk," Isabel moaned, taking unsteady steps, crossing her legs with each stride.

"Same," Penelope said softly. "I've never had to pee this badly in my life. It feels so weird, like I can't control my limbs properly."

Slowly but surely, they returned to their towel. The thing was massive and thick, twelve feet by twelve feet, designed for a whole family to relax on while giving them a fair territory on a crowded beach. "Fold it over," Isabel exhaled, "it'll hold more."

The women moaned and groaned as they bent down to manipulate the towel, folding it in two. Finally, they laid side by side, breathing heavily, their legs tied in knots.

"Here we go," Penelope breathed. "Ready?"

"God, YES," Isabel nearly shouted. "Just be careful not to flood it or we'll still leave a big mark in the sand. Just pee until you can hold the rest. Okay, let's go. Three...two...one..."

"Excuse me?"

The women froze, terrified, as the male voice spoke from directly behind them. Isabel just stared blankly into the early evening sky, too desperate to move, and Penelope craned her neck backwards. There was a lifeguard, about their age and extremely attractive, muscular, and tanned, sitting on an ATV and staring at them with a smile that made Penelope's privates rev up like a riding mower. Somehow, with how insanely distracted they were, they hadn't even registered the sound of the approaching vehicle. "Yes?" she squeaked.

"Didn't see the sign at the entrance?" he said, still flashing that ridiculous smile. "We have to set up the beach for the festival tomorrow. There's gonna be a jetski race along the coast, gotta set up a line for spectators. The beach closes at seven, which is...ten minutes ago. Everybody's gotta get."

"Ohmigod, we're ssoooo sorry," Penelope chirped, rolling to her feet. "We'll leave right now."

Isabel stared at her sister, tears in her eyes. "Penny...I can't," she mouthed silently.

Penelope stood still for a moment. Her eyes darted around, looking for something, anything that could save them. While this lifeguard was here though, they were hopeless. "Uh, sir," Penelope choked out, "we're leaving, promise. Go tell the rest of the people here what's going on, and have a good time setting up. See you tomorrow, maybe."

Seemingly satisfied with this, the disgustingly hot lifeguard nodded, his grin widening. "Sounds good to me. Have a great night, girls." He revved his ATV and took off towards the family two hundred feet down the beach.

"It's gonna come out," Isabel barked the second he was out of earshot. "I can't wait anymore."

"Izzy, we have to go NOW, or he's gonna come back, he's gonna see. If someone who looks like that finds out we peed here, I will fucking kill myself."

"I can't help it, it's too much..."

Penelope shouted in frustration. Not at her sister, she felt only empathy for her sister, rather at life itself at this very moment. Her mind was spiraling madly in every direction, imagining and discarding possible moves like some kind of pee-based Chess Grandmaster. And then she found it.

The houses could see them at the lifeguard chair, but not here. The beachgoers could see them from here, but not at the chair. There was no cover here, and all at once, it hit her that they had been laying on cover this entire time.

THE TOWEL.

Then came the problem of hiding the evidence. They couldn't just leave stains in the sand, but covering it like cats would take time and draw attention. They needed a way to keep the ground dry, a receptacle.

THE COOLER.

"Up. Now," Penelope ordered.

"I'll pee!" Isabel hissed as Penelope grabbed her arm and tried pulling her to her feet.

"Good! Now UP!"

Isabel cursed as she was forced to her feet. She twisted her legs together, praying to every god that humanity had ever dreamt up that nobody was looking her way at this very moment. Penelope took two steps and tore open the cooler. All that was in there at this point was some melted ice packs, empty bottles, and one wine cooler. A necessary sacrifice.

Penelope picked up the towel, looked to her completely frantic sister, and pointed to the cooler. "PEE."

At that, Penelope snapped open the towel and held it out wide, blocking them from everyone else on the beach. The sand was completely clear behind them. The homes were not visible. Isabel, despite her humiliation, had no choice left. She took four small steps to the cooler, slid her bikini bottoms down to her knees, and sat. The moment her skin met the rim of the cooler, her bladder erupted with force enough to rival the ocean in front of her. She moaned in utter ecstasy, leaning forward onto her legs as her immensely powerful stream of pee thundered loudly around the mostly empty plastic. Luckily even this sound was greatly muffled by the environment.

However, it was not muffled enough to not reach Penelope. She was making a big display of shaking out the towel, trying to buy time for her sister's relief, but the sound of Isabel peeing was absolutely killing her. She gasped out loud as she felt herself lose just a tiny bit of control. The crotch of her bikini was dampened by one second of pee, and she instinctively shoved a hand between her legs, letting one side of the towel fall.

"PENNY!" Isabel shrieked as soon as she noticed this, and Penelope cursed, forcing herself to hold the towel up again as she double-crossed her legs, somehow managing to stay upright. "I'll be done soon, please hold out, just a little longer."

"I'm...trying... God, I must look so retarded right now," Penelope cried.

"To me," Isabel started, "you look heroic as all hell. Like Gandalf holding the bridge from the Balrog."

"Pee faster, nerd," Penelope snapped. "I can only fold a towel for so long."

Isabel closed her eyes and squeezed as hard as she could, the pressure of her stream somehow increasing. She could feel her pee splashing all over her butt, but she didn't care in the slightest. She had to have been peeing for over half a minute, but she still had so much left inside of her. Still though, she knew that she couldn't leave her sister like this, so she clenched her fists and moaned in agony as she forced herself to stop peeing. She stood up unsteadily, glancing into the cooler. It was a very large cooler, and she had filled it nearly a quarter way. She knew it would have been over half if she had actually gotten to finish.

"Penny, I'm still bursting, but I can hang on now. Give me the towel and you pee, hurry!" Isabel said, reaching for the giant square.

"It's too late," Penelope said quietly. "Look, the lifeguard's coming back this way."

Isabel peered over the towel. Sure enough, he was riding towards them, and gaining quickly.

"What are you gonna do?" Isabel whispered.

"Close the cooler. We have to leave," Penelope muttered, defeat clear in her voice. Isabel glanced at her sister's legs. She was still dry, but Isabel had no idea how long that could possibly last, seeing how Penelope had needed to go so much worse than she herself had earlier.

"Can you make it?"

"Just get the cooler. Now." Penelope's voice was stiff and deep, every fiber of her being focused on not wetting her swimsuit in front of the lifeguard.

Isabel nodded and closed the cooler just in time, the lifeguard pulling up a second later. The other beachgoers had already cleared the dunes.

"You two are the only ones left. I got other people coming. You really need to clear off." His attitude was beginning to ruin his attractiveness, and Penelope scowled.

"Yes. We're going. Have a lovely evening," she droned, picking up both of their purses. He nodded and rode off again, and Isabel immediately gave him the double-bird behind his back. She then picked up the cooler, and they began heading up towards the dunes.

Isabel looked at her sister. Penelope's whole body was shaking. Her fists were clenched so tightly that the veins in her arms were visible, and her shoulders were hunched up into her neck. Every few steps she released a shaky moan. Her bladder was so distended that she could have been a few months pregnant, the great round bulge pressing out the front of her bikini bottoms. Isabel had no idea how Penelope would escape this with her dignity intact. Even if the lifeguard was out of sight, which he was not, the houses were already visible. They began climbing the walkway that led up the beachgrass-covered dunes, a steep incline of rock and compressed sand. Penelope yelped with every step up now, her control clearly failing with every passing second.

They were at the top now. There was a square platform, fenced in with large wooden dowels, with a bench set towards the back for looking over the beach. The boardwalk was in front of them, dozens of people walking back and forth, enjoying the cooling evening after a punishingly hot day. Between the walkers and the lifeguard, there was simply no escape. To make matters even worse, the lifeguard was joined by three others who had just come down the next walkway, a woman and two other men. Penelope sighed deeply. "Well, I tried." She set the purses she was carrying on the bench, opened her legs, placed her hands on her hips, and took a deep breath.

Isabel knew what was coming. She had to do something, she had to save Penelope as Penelope had saved her. She dropped the cooler and looked to the bench. It would provide cover from the boardwalk, but not from the lifeguards. Even squatting, they would be visible. Just as the answer occurred to Isabel, Penelope began wetting herself uncontrollably. The crotch of her bikini was instantly inflated with pee before the liquid began pouring out, splattering in every direction. With no time left to do it properly, Isabel threw her arms out with a "Nyeeh!" and shoved Penelope hard into the rocky sand. She cursed as she hit the ground, pee still spraying out of her, pooling around her butt and soaking into the sand.

"The fuck was that?!" Penelope yelled, rubbing a scraped elbow and groaning as the pee spread up to her back.

"I just figured it out," Isabel sighed. "The bench covers us from the boardwalk, but the grass on the dunes won't cover us standing, sitting, or squatting. Laying down, though, you're invisible from both sides."

"So you just yeeted me into the goddamn rocks?" Penelope bitched.

"Don't say 'Yeet.' And you were already frickin' peeing, so yeah. I was GOING TO have you do it into the towel like we were gonna do before that life-dick showed up, but you had other plans."

Penelope just fell back, fate accepted, as she continued emptying her bladder through her swimsuit. "God, it feels so good," she breathed. "It's like twenty orgasms at once." She moaned as she absolutely flooded the platform, the pee spreading far faster than the compacted sand could absorb it. "What will we do about the puddle? If one of the lifeguards come up here, they'll know."

"Not much we can do about that," Isabel conceded. "I figure we'll dump the cooler. If there's enough liquid, maybe their brains won't go right to pee. They'll just think we dumped a cooler chock full of ice water. The wind should clear out any scent pretty quickly."

"It's the best we got," Penelope said with a nod. "Hey, you still need to pee, right?"

"Yeah, badly," Isabel confirmed, crossing her legs.

Penelope smiled and patted the soaked ground next to her. "Well, come on."

Isabel giggled and got on her knees. "Might as well at this point, eh?" She laid down next to her sister and in less than a second, she was flooding her own swimsuit, her puddle joining Penelope's. They both stared into the sky, enjoying their long-delayed relief, their bulging bladders slowly shrinking down to normal size. It felt so warm, so nice after all the stress they had dealt with over the past two hours, and their minds were completely clear as their flows came to a stop at nearly the same time. They laid there for a moment longer before they clambered to their feet. Pedestrians continued walking past. The lifeguards were setting up a series of flags. They had not been spotted.

Penelope stepped up to the bench and opened up the purses, retrieving their street clothes as Isabel dumped the pee out of the cooler, making sure not to drop the ice packs, empty bottles, or the remaining wine cooler. After she did so, the entire surface of the platform was damp. It was true, no one who saw this would think it was pee. It was just too much to be plausible. Nobody could possibly do this. They grinned at each other as Penelope tossed Isabel her blue-green sundress and pulled on her own violet one. The two of them gave one last look to the darkened platform, hoped for the best, and began their long walk home.

Thanks everybody. This was a fun one to write. Very "pure," so to speak. No long, fancy plot to pace out the action like most stuff I write. This was just meant to be a one-off short story so I'm not gonna promise anything, but maybe I'll use the same characters again, I dunno. Glad you all enjoyed it, and thanks for the support.
