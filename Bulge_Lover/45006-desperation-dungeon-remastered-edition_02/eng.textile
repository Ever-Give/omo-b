Necroing again, but would you make a sequel of this story in the future?

I wrote this story to have a solid ending with the possibility of spinoffs and continuation. I have a lot of other projects going on, but if I feel like adding to this universe, I can and will. However, I can make no such promises. I'm as clueless as you are lol.
