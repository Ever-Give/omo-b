Hello! I thought I'd tried crossposting some of my omo/watersports oriented fics from AO3 to here as well, to spread the omolove! This one is being uploaded right around the same time as on AO3, and for Femslash February! I'm a little early for my timezone, so congrats, yuri enjoyers! I wrote this one for FE Engage, and I enjoyed Ivy a lot when I played, which means she must Engage (heh) in my favorite kink. I haven't played in a while, thought, so if there's an OOC that's why. Welp, let's rock and roll!

“Ah! Céline! I’ve been looking for you!”

Upon hearing the voice of the Divine Dragon, Céline slid the marking ribbon of her novel between the pages.

“Divine One! Pleasure to see you. To what do I owe the honor of this meeting?”

“I actually had something I wanted to ask you about.” Alear shifted on her feet and fiddled with some of her blue strands of hair.

It was rather adorable how someone of such power and authority could still come across as so demure.

“I was hoping you could give me a recommendation for teas that work well with a certain flavor.”

Céline could feel the giddiness burst up in her chest, even as she maintained her composure.

“Oh, what a joy! I’d be more than happy to help! So, what sort of flavor pairing were you looking for? A specific pastry? Or perhaps you were looking to complement a savory dish?”

“Actually, it’s a little unusual… I was looking for a tea that would work with something that’s salty and a bit bitter.”

…Bitter and salty?

“That’s… certainly a unique flavor profile. Teas are generally bitter, which is why they go so well with sweets, with different herbal and floral notes pairing with different specific flavors.” Céline drummed her fingers on her cheek. “Though I suppose that means the inverse would work well – a sweet tea to cut the bitterness. Sweet and salty flavors also play nicely, so I think that would be the best.” A smile crept onto her face. “Naturally sweet teas aren’t common, but I have a lovely fruit and cacao blend from one of Firene’s coastal towns that I think would suit this wonderfully. It’s still a little bitter, but the fruits mask most of it, and the deeper notes of the cacao pair nicely with the salt.” She let out a wistful sigh at the memory of its taste. “I believe I have a cannister of it stored in my quarters, if you’d like to try some. I can brew the pot while-“

Alear held her hand up to pause her. “I truly appreciate the offer, but… Would it be any trouble to let have some of the blend? I wanted to set some special up for Ivy and myself, and-”

“Say no more.”

Céline should have deduced the Divine Dragon was planning a surprise for her wife. “You’ll have it in your quarters before dusk. Though, I have to say, I am curious as to what you’re pairing it with… Is there some new herb you want to try baking into a pastry? Or a new vegetable?”

“My apologies, but I’d really rather keep that private.”

“Oh! No worries, never you mind, then.” Even if she hadn’t been raised to have royal etiquette, Céline still knew better than to pry into someone’s business too closely.

Despite that, as she waved farewell to the Divine Dragon, the interest as to what she was doing still nagged at her. Just what was Alear planning to use the tea for?

Ivy had never been good with heat.

It was to be expected, considering the frigid temperatures of Elusia, even in the height of summer. She could bear through the whipping winds of the northern kingdom, but the pounding sun of Solm’s deserts had her melting to a puddle within minutes.

And her current position left her face so warm that those deserts would have felt chilly in comparison.

Kneeling in the Divine Dragon’s private quarters, skirt of her dress hiked up to her navel, small teapot settled on the floor between her legs. A thrum went through her bladder as it pressed against the laced waist of her panties. She knew she hadn’t broken yet, so that moisture soaking the fabric must have been from something else. Sweat from the same heat that plagued her face? Or, the more likely culprit, the gaze of the one who asked her to take this position, loving and watching a scant couple of feet before her.

The gaze that left her to brine in her own arousal.

It was almost painful how happy she looked. As Ivy’s thighs shook, not from the weight they held up but from the desperation to go, Alear still watched eagerly. Red and blue both glimmered in anticipation of what was to come.

Yet, when those eyes met hers, that glimmer ceased.

“Ivy? Are you alright?”

The question surprised her. It really shouldn’t – of course the Divine Dragon, symbol of kindness and prosperity, would show concern for her own wife of all people. Though, Ivy knew very well she’d receive that same worry regardless of their relationship.

And it was so easy to love her because of it. So simple. Just wanting to help and do what’s best for the denizens of Elyos. To protect her people no matter the cost.

Ivy’s initial devotion may have been born from an act of rebellion, but she’s certain she would have given herself whole to the Divine One in sincerity had she been a follower of Sombron like the rest of the royal court.

As such, there was no way she could let her deity, her love, her wife down by fumbling her… unusual request.

“I am fine. This is just a… novel experience for me.”

The concern on Alear’s face worsened with a furrowed brow.

“Are you certain? I’m aware that this isn’t exactly a normal ask of you. I wouldn’t have even expected you to consider it, much less follow through. So, if you have any discomfort or hesitation, we can just put this whole thing aside.”

Ivy gripped the hem of her dress tighter. She was shaking worse than when she’d been camping with Timerra. Of course it’d be worry over disappointing Alear that would have her nerves fraying worse than her fear of ghosts.

“As I said, I am fine.” She tried not to grit her teeth as she spoke. “This is certainly… far more unorthodox than I would normally permit. The idea of urination being arousing is something that would have never crossed my mind. But, novel and… disgusting though it may be, it is…” Ivy averted her eyes. “It is something I am willing to do. For you, Divine One.”

A warm, gentle hand came up to caress her face, and on instinct Ivy leaned into her wife’s touch.

“Ivy, I’ve seen how deep your love for me runs. And I love how you show it in your own way, even when you keep up your unflappable appearance.” A thumb brushed over her cheek, almost feeling like a kiss. “But I’m not asking this of you as a god, or as the Divine Dragon. I’m asking you as your wife.” Alear’s hand turned her face, bringing their eyes together, and letting Ivy see the warmth and care in that mismatched gaze. “And you’re allowed to say ‘no’ to your wife, Ivy.”

Breath halted in Ivy’s throat for a moment. Her muscles froze, even her quaking legs. The only thing she could feel moving on her was more slick dribbling down into her panties.

“I… I am grateful that you wanted to share this with me, Divine One.” She let the air in her throat move again with a deep inhale, deep exhale. “The thought of this is, admittedly, horrifying and repulsive. But,” That last word came with an instant force to shut down any more words of hesitation. “When I know I am doing this for you – for my goddess, my wife – I… feel a deep warmth. It’s rather odd, but it is pleasant. Even if it’s pleasant in a strange and, quite frankly, humiliating way. So,” Another deep breath. “I will bear through it. For you… Alear.”

For all the bricks of ice she had stacked to guard herself from the courtly politics of Elusia, nothing could have melted them faster than the lights that burst from Alear’s eyes.

“Ivy…”

Ivy brought her own hand up to dust over Alear’s. “I will also respect your wishes and tell you if it becomes too much. However, I intend to see this through. So, please. Let us proceed.” Formal and firm as always, despite her position.

The sweet look she was given could crumble her easily if she allowed it.

“Thank you, Ivy. Remember, I want you to enjoy this, too.” Alear’s hand slipped down between exposed thighs, hovering under soaked, silky fabric. “If you need to stop, at any time, just say the word.”

Ivy nodded.

Fingers made contact with her panties.

Every fiber of her willpower threatened to snap at the press of her own wetness into her.

Her eyes slammed shut, trying to hold on as the feather light strokes over her clothed sex unwound her, slow and steady.

Each little twitch of her sex, each shiver in pleasure, had Ivy feeling another pang in her bladder. She could feel Alear’s other hand start stroking her face, thumb rubbing gentle circles on her cheek.

Those heavenly fingers pressed harder. Ivy was helpless to prevent both the undignified squeak and a small spurt of urine leak out from it. She shot one hand up to hold onto Alear’s shoulder, needing some purchase to not come undone immediately.

Then the fingers began stroking. Slick glides across her folds, the panties practically not there. Pressing and rubbing her lips together, little jolts running up the dips of her hips. Each shake of her hips jostling her bladder, her two needs melding and mixing in cacophony. Each little shift making it harder and harder to hold on. Each breath choking more and more. The short, harsh puffs of air making her head spin.

Ivy could have sworn that breath was going to run out, asphyxiate her from pleasure and humiliation, when salvation came. A press onto the lips of her face this time – pillowy, soft. Divine. Her generous wife, giving a kiss of life from this splendid agony. Her rough, unknowing grip on Alear’s arm softened, her heart no longer trying to leap from her chest. When she finally had some (relative) stability back, those haven lips pulled off, kind words whispering out.

“Ivy… you can go. Whenever you’re ready.”

She nodded into the warmth of Alear’s hand. Those fingers brought her right up to the brink. Ivy felt Alear’s thumb move up to rub circles around her clit, finally tipping her over.

Her hips ground down shamefully onto those fingers, riding out the pulses of pleasure coursing through her. As it faded out, Ivy felt the ache in her bladder trying yet failing to burst out. Even with the desperate need, she hadn’t moved past the fundamentals of her potty training to fully let go and flood her already soaked undergarments.

A few deep breathes in to steady herself. Let the muscles relax. Pretend the soaking arousal under her was from her already breaking.

Then, the stream started. A tinkle through her panties, pouring over her wife’s fingers into the waiting teapot. The digits pulled off, just in time to avoid spraying the stream all over as that tinkle turned to a hiss. Ivy felt her face pull tight at the sharp splatter of her own waste hitting the porcelain and loose leaves. Even over the sound of the stream, she could hear Alear’s gasp.

The raging river of piss slowed to a babbling brook, then to a trickle, then to stray drops into the pool. Despite trying to calm her breathing before going, Ivy now found her chest heaving. She slowly opened her eyes, attempting to adjust to the light once more.

And was promptly blinded by the joyous light shining from Alear in front of her. Giddy as a child seeing a dessert just for them, she was staring at the near-full teapot between Ivy’s legs. When she looked up to meet Ivy’s eyes, the warmth of the light made Ivy think she’d faint of heat exhaustion.

“Thank you, Ivy. For doing this for me.”

Oh, how her heart could melt as much as her loins already have.

“Let’s get you cleaned up.”

As she heard the “tea” pour out of the spout and into its matching teacup, Ivy couldn’t help but fidget in her seat. While the desperate urge to relieve her bladder was gone, her humiliation had only come back in full force. There was genuine concern her panties would be soaked again. And so shortly after changing them, no less.

The was the clink of the tea strainer being removed. The clink of the teacup rising from the saucer.

A barely audible sip. A refreshed sigh.

“…Do you enjoy it, Divine One?”

“I do. I’ll have to find a way to properly thank Céline for the tea recommendation.”

“I’m… glad.”

The air held pregnant, disturbed by the teacup settling on the saucer.

“Ivy…”

“I am fine, Divine One. I have no regrets doing this. I just… require some distance from the end result. I would not hesitate to do it for you again, but I am afraid my heart may actually give out if I see you drink my… excreta.”

She couldn’t honestly say if the arousal or the embarrassment would do her in on that.

“I think I need to find a way to thank you properly as well.” Alear’s words shocked her, though not enough to make her turn around. “As I said before, I know this was an unusual ask, and you carried on as beautifully as always. You deserve something equal from me in turn.”

“I truly appreciate the gesture. But I will decline. Your happiness is blessing enough.”

The porcelain clinked together again, and Alear hummed.

“What if I wanted you to ask me for something?”

That gave Ivy pause. Color flooded her cheeks faster than she had flooded the teapot on the small table between them several minutes ago.

“I… would consider it.”

Ivy heard another sip, with a much more please hum following.

“That’s all I could ask for.”
