What's a writing cue?

It's a one-liner, a short phrase that makes you say: "There's one hell of a story in that and I want to write it NOW!"

Here's one to get you started:

"She felt the familiar trickle on her leg"

Feel free to reply with anything that you hear around you - "Fill 'er up!" - or any phrase that comes to mind.

...Like Liesje' s wonderful remark, in Wetset's message board, as she spent an afternoon on the beach in her bikini:

"...waiting for the inevitable loss of control"

If you do pick up a cue here, post the story in a topic of its own: but do, please, put in a link to the writing cue that got you started.
