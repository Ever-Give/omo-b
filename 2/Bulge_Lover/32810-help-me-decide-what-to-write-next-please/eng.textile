So I want to take a break from Lunambra for a bit before writing part 2 of Dreams but I have three ideas and can't decide. Please vote.

1- Spartacus: Piss and Sand - Desperation story about Lucretia from Spartacus, stuck at the arena with nowhere to go.

2- Full on the Firefly 3 - Starring Inara and Saffron getting themselves in a pride-fueled holding contest.

3- A story starring Diane from the anime Seven Deadly Sins, this would be really out there considering Diane's status as a giant, and would take longer to write because I need to rewatch the series first so I can refresh my memories on everyone's personalities. Story name TBD.
