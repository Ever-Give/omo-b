Hi! My name is Brianna and I am a freelance writer who can write fantasy to articles, and I myself am into Omorashi as well! Because of this and my need to make ends meet this month I am advertising here in hopes of helping people get a personalized story that does everything for them that they could possibly want. I have examples of my work to provide, as well as non-omo stories if that is what you're looking for and my prices start at a cent per word, but goes up to two cents per word if the story goes over 10k words. I do require I am paid before I start working but I have posted before almost a year ago and have left nothing but happy customers and would love to work with such a sweet community again!

I can be reached easily by email or Discord!
