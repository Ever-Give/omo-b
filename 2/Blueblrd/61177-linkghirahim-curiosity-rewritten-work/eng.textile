What's up everyone! I wrote a Fanfiction on Archive about Ghirahim and Link, I really hope you wanna give it a shot since I'm really proud of it and I want people who enjoy cute scenes to see it! I am immensely proud of this fanfiction, as it was a rewrite of an old fanfiction I wrote in I think 2016 which is on the same account if you wanna see it! I plan on having a story this time and I will be updating soon I just really want people to enjoy what I write.

Summary:

Link's been having nightmares, can't seem to think straight unless his hands are more busy than his mind. It's tearing him apart, the shame he feels too great. On the day he is supposed to be taking time off to recover after the giant scorpion fight in the Lanayru mining facility, everything goes wrong when he feels the need to prove himself to the one person who's opinion's hurt him the most...Himself.
