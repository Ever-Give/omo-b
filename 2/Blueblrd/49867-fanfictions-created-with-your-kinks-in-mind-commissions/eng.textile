Good Morning! My name is Brianna and I have been a freelance writer for going on seven years now. I am looking for work and giving you the opportunity to purchase a work of fiction or non-fiction that you will truly enjoy.

No matter what you want out of a work of fiction, a simple romance or a story that indulges fantasies you've never even dreamed about before. You can ask for any character you would like, Supergirl, Mothman even Freddy Kruger, or an OC you've created yourself.

I have many examples of my work, and I have worked with all types of kinks if you're looking for a story that will indulge any aspect of what you enjoy. Messing, wetting, even ABDL are all types of kinks I have worked with writing before and some of which I even enjoy myself frequently, so you know you'll get a product that is from a person who enjoys a community just as much as you do.

My rates are non-negotiable, I apologize for the inconvenience, but I cannot sell for less as I do this for a living.

I write for a cent per word to translate that 1k words is ten dollars, 500 is 5 dollars, and so on and so forth.

To contact me, and see examples of my work you can use any of these methods
