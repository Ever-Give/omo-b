It wasn’t easy to admit, but it had become more and more difficult to tell when she had wet her pull-up. She used to feel the pressure in her bladder that told her to stop working and get to the restroom, but her control had been slipping. The time she had between feeling the signal from her bladder and the moment her bladder decided to relax had been getting shorter and shorter. A few mortifying accidents had led her to buy Goodnites at the store. But recently, she would get up from whatever she was doing and feel slightly damp. When had that happened? She was now in the habit of sticking her finger in the crotch of the Goodnight just to make sure. It was becoming more clear that it might be time to try out one of the diapers she had ordered online last month…

Note: Hey guys! It's me, Bbabybbear! I've always been an enthusiastic lurker on here, but I'd like to post more often as this is where I find so much amazing content that turns me on. I see a lot of photos of mine that were posted here without my consent. I get that that's sometimes the name of the game. But I'd rather post my own, so here I go. Enjoy!
