You think hypnotists are fake but your friends thinks they are real and wants to prove it to you so she takes you to a show. you scoff at the show saying fake and the people up there are in on it. the hypnotist says i see we have a skeptic if i am indeed fake why not let me hypnotize you. fine you say but you dont realize your friend is in on it getting revenge for you always making fun of her. she told the hypnotist to hypnotize you so that every time something about a toilet or bathroom is mentioned you will pee your pants. you go up there and the hypnotist does his thing. later on after the show you still think its fake and didnt work until your friend says wait up i have to pee, all of a sudden you notice your are peeing your pants.

You stop but there is a wet spot on your pants. your friend comes back from the bathroom and asks what happened laughing. you say i dont know when you said you had to pee i wet myself. she says ha thats what you get, the hypnotist worked. i had him hypnotize you to pee yourself everytime someone mentioned anything about toilets or bathrooms. now maybe you wont make fun of me anymore. you agree and say ok lets go back and un hypnotize me. you go to go back and he does. you no longer make fun of your friend. lol
