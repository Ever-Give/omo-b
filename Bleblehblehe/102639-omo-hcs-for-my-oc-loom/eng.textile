Loom.

(female)

- tinyass bladder. Strong as hell though.

- can probably hold for about 4 hours

- can probably hide her need really well even when she’s on the verge of wetting herself.

- will tell absolutely NO ONE. (She’s shy.)

- will try and sneak away without making it obvious

- the signs she needs to go is legs squeezed together, deep breathing, pacing, looking around a lot, and hands squeezed into a fist.

- will be frozen in fear if she wets, probably cries silently too

- will need comfort. A lot of it.

- will probably never forget about it and will overthink it for years

- wets the bed sometimes from nightmares. like once a week.

I wanna write a fic of her with another oc.
