A movie night

For Vox there was no doubt that he was definitely a person who’s very busy, interns, annoying interviewers, and events out of nowhere made it near impossible for him to have any time to himself at all. Which is why at some points he would even go as far to neglect his own needs for the sake of work. Like eating, sleeping, and of course. Using the bathroom.

His little habit of course had its own issues, sometimes he would come back home barely being able to move without leaking, not to mention that one time where pee was already dipping down his leg by the time he got to the bathroom. He’s had more close calls than he can count, but he’s never had a full-blown accident, so why stop? Maybe he should’ve given himself a second thought before the events of today would happen.

“Voxxy! Come out, there’s something I wanna tell you!” Valentino had been knocking at Vox’s door for the past five minutes and he honestly had a good reason for that. Vox had been putting off his need to pee all day, now he was really paying for it. He was just trying to regain his composure before opening the door. “Vox if you don’t open the I’m burning it down!” After taking a few deep breaths, Vox had finally managed to at least look dignified before opening the door.

“What?!” He yelled when he opened the door, Valentino did not look amused at all. “You’ve been doing nothing but work for god-knows how long, and you’ve just ignored me the entire time.” “Well what do you wanna me to do to make it up huh? And don’t expect me to suck you off, I’m not in the mood for that.” Valentino didn’t even try and answer, he just picked up Vox and started walking.

“Val what the fuck?!” Vox could feel the liquid in his bladder sloshing like an ocean, he ended up squeezing his eyes and legs together to try and hold it. “I’m just trying to keep you from getting burnt out, now shut up and try to calm down.” Valentino plopped Vox down onto the couch, making the TV demons bladder jolt with shock. “Stay here, I’ma go get some food.” And left Vox alone.

The next 20 minutes was the longest time of his life, he had his hands gripping onto his crotch, and desperately cross his legs like he was tying them in a knot. But then he realized, if Val isn’t here, he can just go and use the bathroom without having to explain anything. Vox slowly got up and started walking to the door of the living room, right when Valentino appeared right in front of him. Vox let out a little scream in surprise, before clearing his throat and holding his crotch through his pockets.

“Sorry Val, but I need to do something real quick.” But when Vox tried to shimmy his way past him, the moth wrapped his arm around him and took him right back to the damn couch. “Voxxy, I told you very clearly to stay here didn’t I? I’m gonna have to punish you for that.” He said as he sat Vox down on his lap and having one of his wings wrapped around him. “Like I told you, I’m not in the mood.” Vox, said with an annoyed look, and tried to pull away, but Val’s wing held him tight. “You’re not gonna get the claps, but you’re gonna get punished, you won’t learn if you don’t.” And so after all that, all Vox could do was accept his fate.

“So you a horror movie? I know you don’t take them too well…” Valentino said, he still remembers that one time he had to haul Vox out a cinema cause he couldn’t stop screaming. (Not to mention that he was essentially glued to Val for the rest of the day.) “That incident was a year ago! I don’t care for jumpscares anymore.” Vox said with a pouty face. “Fine, but just know that I’m not sleeping with a bright ass night light for you.” Val said as he turned on the movie, and handed over some fast food over to Vox.

30 minutes into the movie, Vox was starting to regret his decision of letting. Valentino do this. Not only was the movie scaring him into hiding underneath Val’s wing, but he was also getting more desperate with his need to pee. He took a deep breath and started rubbing his legs together a little bit. “Hey, I gave you a warning, you were the one that chose to put on this movie!” Val said with a teasing laugh. “Shut up…” only thing is that when Vox said that his voice was so quiet it was barely above a whisper. “Aye pobrecito…Hey Voxxy, I didn’t mean to make you feel bad…” Val said while pulling Vox in closer to try and comfort him. “I’m ok! You don’t have to worry!” Vox said trying to keep his confidence, but behind that smug smile was a demon who really needed a bathroom break.

After about an hour and half later Vox had made the mistake of drinking the entire cup of coke Valentino got him, now he was really starting to feel it. He hates that his bladder always does this. When he’s talking with someone he forgets all about his bladder, but when he’s not, it comes back to punch him in the lower abdomen. And the movie wasn’t helping, he nearly leaked with every jumpscare… Then eventually, there was another scare that was so bad Vox couldn’t help but scream and burry his face into his knees.

“Voxxy calm down it’s just a movie, I can’t hurt you.” Val said with an annoyed tone. “S- sorry… I-“ before Vox could finish his sentence he was hit with a sharp pang in his bladder making him start squirming uncontrollably and eyes prick the edges of his eyes. “Voxxy, what’s got you dancing around like this?” All Valentino got as an answer from Vox was a muffled whimper. Valentino decided to turn the movie off, and let Vox out of his wings grasp. Only to see a shaking demon on his knees and hands having a death grip on the couch.

“Voxxy I’m gonna need you to tell me what’s wrong, I can’t help you if you don’t.” Valentino was genuinely worried at this point, did the movie really scare him that bad? “I- I’m really-“ Vox clenched his teeth so hard he thought they were gonna break, making a high pitch whine. “Voxxy I’m gonna need you to tell me…” He sat down next to Vox, put his hand on his shoulder, and took note of his behavior. Was he sick or something, was he scared, he was squirming… maybe… and when Vox’s hand goes to his crotch, it finally clicks. Vox needed to pee.

“Voxxy! Come one let’s go.” Valentino said as he hurried to get Vox’s wrist, get him off the couch, and try to lead him to the bathroom, only for Vox to whimper almost immediately after he gets up. No matter how much he wanted to Vox just couldn’t move, he was completely and utterly fucked. “Stay calm Vox…” Valentino kept trying to lead him, but it would only end in Vox having a spurt escape from his crotch. By this point Vox had a pretty noticeable wet spot, and spurt kept coming out of him nonstop.

By that point Valentino sighed and said “Just let go already…” as much as he wanted to get Box to the bathroom, there was no use if he was gonna be in pain. “N- No!” Vox said while trying to hold back the liquid in his body. “Come on you’ll feel so much better…” Valentino said with a slight laugh. And when Vox shook his head again, Valentino got closer to him, and rubbed his bladder so lightly it almost tickled and said. “Let it all out… Your bladder probably so full after that drink I gave you… come on…pssssssssssssssss.”

Water sounds. That’s it. It’s all over. Vox started wetting himself. He couldn’t believe this could happen to him. And Valentino didn’t care. He didn’t care how disgusting this would’ve been to some people, he didn’t care that the puddle was slowly getting closer to his shoe. All that mattered at the moment was keeping Vox calm. So he just kept on rubbing those gentle circles to where his bladder would’ve been. Just to make sure that Vox wouldn’t try to stop the stream and possibly hurting himself by doing so.

After about two minutes, Vox’s stream finally ended. Vox was shivering from the chill he got from his clothes sticking to his body. He thought Valentino would be mad at him, for putting off his break, and wetting himself like a small child. So why would Valentino be so calm..? “Shh, shh, don’t cry Voxxy I’m not mad at you…” Vox didn’t even notice he had been crying the entire time, but now that he noticed it made him cry harder.

“Pobrecito… you don’t have to feel bad, accidents happen.” Valentino said as he brought him in for a hug, rubbing comforting circles into his back. “You’re not mad..?” Vox said, his voice muffled in his chest. “Of course not! You just should’ve told me that you needed to go.” “I will next time…” Vox said as he nuzzled his head closer to the moth. “Now I think what you need is a bath and a change of clothes don’t you?” “Yeah…”
