This is a sequel to A Little Game. (it’s great.)

###

It had been about 3 days since ‘the mess incident’ with Valentino and Vox. Those days were all a blur, at least to Vox. He didn’t know why, but something about that incident drove him CRAZY. His mind wouldn’t stop spiraling with pee desperation scenarios. He tried to get them to stop, drowning himself in work, alcohol, and smoke didn’t do shit. He wanted to see his on-and-off partner that way… He wanted to see him squirming like a pathetic little baby like he was that one night. But there’s no way he would have the nerve to go and ask Valentino for that!

Right..?

Vox was sitting one the couch in The Vees living room. Velvette was out at a late night show and was probably getting blackout drunk, and Valentino was sitting on the couch beside Vox. The movie Velvette put on to babysit them was boring them the fuck out. The two hadn’t done much all day, all frickin week, and it was driving them to the worst case of cabin fever. And worst of all the boredom made Vox’s mind drift off to those piss fantasies…

Valentino nuzzling into Vox’s chest as Val whimpered from the fullness-

NO! No matter how hard the tv demon had tried to block out those thoughts, they kept coming back. And to top it off, the one he was fantasizing about was RIGHT NEXT TO HIM. What was he thinking?! Vox tried to clear his mind, when Valentino suddenly got up.

“I need to take a piss, be right back.”

That sentence made Vox’s fantasies run so wild, he suddenly stepped in front of Valentino and started forcing him back down on the couch. “Hey~ what’s got you so desperate?~” Valentino said with that annoying seductive tone. Vox started having second thoughts about if he was really gonna ask the moth about this. It’s not like he thought it would be weird, the man’s into everything in the book, he just didn’t believe he was gonna let down his walls of pride because of a request from the moth… But Val was staring at the tv with eyes of curiosity, there’s no going back now.

“Listen… there’s something I wanna ask you about.” Vox said with his hands having a hard grip on Valentino’s shoulders, his monitor was hanging down in shame. “Well tell me mi amor~” Valentino said, his lower arm picked up Vox’s head by his ‘chin’. There was no point in trying to keep his secret anymore, Valentino was too intrigued, so after a deep breath, Vox said “Ever since the incident I can’t stop thinking about it.” “You mean you suddenly have a kink for piss?” Valentino said, he sat in top of Vox’s lap and started squirming to be a tease. “I-… I guess you could say that…” Val’s eyes lit up, a cheeky smile spreading across his face. “Ooo! You should’ve told sooner! You wanna see me piss myself don’t you??”

“…”

”Yes.”

Out of nowhere, Vox grabbed his hands and started dragging him to the door. “Let’s go to the bar, we can walk there, it’s not that far.” The building was near empty, so the two were free to talk about their re match of a game as much as they wanted. “And even while I need to go? You’re such an excited bitch!” Valentino said. “Tell me the second you start feeling desperate, I’ll decide what to do with you from there…” Vox said as the duo walked. “Just know I’m not paying for shit.”

The duo arrived at the bar and were ordering some glasses of water and tequila. “We have this at base you know, why’d we come all the way over here?” Valentino said slightly annoyed. “Less talking, more drinking.” Vox said as he pushed a glass into the moths hands. Val did as he said and was downing the drinks like nothing. Managing to drink 3 glasses of tequila and two glasses of water in 5 minutes. Vox had drank a glass of tequila and water too, but not as much as Val. He had a plan to get the moth to his bursting point. That was a fact.

“Voxxy… I gotta go…” Valentino whined as he placed his head on Vox’s shoulder, shifting in his chair. “Can you hold it? I got you one more glass in water… don’t want you completely wasted.” Vox said as he rubbed the moths head awake, passing him the glass. “Ta bueno…” He drank the entire glass in one go, he started to rub his thighs together with a look of discomfort on his face. “Ight, we should get going now, I just need to pay.” And much to Valentino’s dismay, Vox decided to strike up a long conversation with the bartender, his bladder was aching…

“Have a good night!” Vox said as the duo walked out. Valentino was feeling woozy from the alcohol, and that definitely wasn’t helping with his situation. “Voxxy! I need to go! Can we go back?” He said while doing a little potty dance. “We’ll get there, I just need to pee first.” Vox said as he suddenly pulled the two of them into an alleyway. “You don’t even think about trying to pee here. Just keep an eye on me kay?” He said as he pulled ‘it’ out and started peeing against the wall.

It was excruciating for the moth to see. Normally he would’ve been excited, but right now it was pure torture! He squirmed all over the place with a death grip on his crotch, he could even feel his underwear dampen a little. “Ahh, that’s a relief, too bad you didn’t get to go~” Vox said as he started to drag the moth out of the alleyway and back to their walk back to base. “Imagine how full of piss you are right now? You must be overflowing!” Vox said as he suddenly hugged Valentino tightly. “Not so tight baby, or the games gonna end too soon…” Val said with a whine. “Don’t be such a pissbaby, we’re almost there.”

After 15 long minutes the two idiots got back to base and walked over to Valentinos room. “We gonna get started now? I’m about to burst!” Vox pushed Valentino down to the bed and took off his and Valentino’s shoes. (They’re a pain to get piss out of.) “You’ve been so good holding it all in for me, I can tell you really need to go…” Vox said as he sat in his knees next to him. “Lay down and don’t hold your crotch, I wanna try something.” Val laid down and had his hands clasped together over his chest. He was shivering all over, tears were pricking his eyes, a high pitch whine escaped his throat.

“This is what it takes to break your pride? A little piss in you?” Vox thought it was hilarious that the feared, sadistic, moth was turned into a whiny bitch just because of a few drinks. “I’m holding an ocean! Fuck you mean ‘little’?!” Vox laughed and pressed down on the poor moths bladder. “Don’t let go til I say bitch.” Valentino was practically crying from the pressure in his bladder, why won’t Vox let him go?! “Por favor! Let me go!” Val said with his legs shaking. “Can you say please one more time?” Vox said as he rubbed his hand across the moths bladder teasingly. “Please! Please let me go!” Vox lifted his hand from the moths bladder, and said,

”let go now…”

And just like that, Valentino started to flood his bed with pee. He moaned in relief, his eyes were watering, it was pure bliss… And Vox was savoring every moment of it, taking in the sight of someone so prideful, become a sobbing mess because he had to go potty. After a while, Vals stream ended, and he was left shivering and sighing in relief.

“There we go, feeling better?” Vox asked while pulling Valentino into a hug, rubbing his back. “Yeah…” “Now I’m gonna get you cleaned up, and we’ll talk after that.”

After a bath, and some warm tea, the two were now relaxing in Vox’s bed with Valentinos head resting on Vox’s lap. “Don’t worry about your mattress, I get a new one, it was already gross anyways…” Vox said while rubbing the moths head. “I gotta say, this was fun, should do it again some time.” Valentino said with a tired voice. “We will, let’s just sleep for now, I’m exhausted…” The two got cozy with blankets, and snuggled together as they both drifted of into a deep sleep.

THE ENDING😩❤️
