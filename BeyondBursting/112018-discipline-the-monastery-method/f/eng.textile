Discipline: The Monastery Method

She’d heard plenty about it before: a silent retreat in the southern French Alps, near the village of Saint-Véran—the highest inhabited village in Europe. Still, Noa had never quite dared to go. She was into mindfulness and self-love, sure—but seven days that far from home? A bit much. Until this year. This year, she decided to go for it. And on May 1st, she stood at the door with her suitcase in hand.

If she’d known in advance how the week would unfold, she might have thought twice.

“Welcome to Sainte-Marguerite,” said La Mère Supérieure. “We’re so glad you’re here, and it’s wonderful that you’ve chosen Silencio Dei.”

Noa glanced around. About fifteen women, and just two men—each standing beside a small suitcase. Everyone looked around her age or older. Noa was 25, short, and blonde—though she still got asked for ID.

La Mère continued, “For the next seven days, you will neither speak nor gesture during daylight hours. To truly embrace self-love, you’ll surrender control and live according to the monastery’s rhythm.”

She began outlining the main house rules for the new 'nuns': “Your rooms are simple. That’s intentional. Anything unnecessary has been left out. The daily schedule is not adjusted for individual needs. Bathroom visits take place at the designated times—outside those windows, the doors remain closed. This week, we do not let our basic needs dictate our actions. That, of course, includes any form of sexual activity—whether with someone else or yourself. Anyone who breaks the rules ends the retreat and severs their connection with God.”

The tour began. Noa and the rest of the group followed La Mère through the monastery. The silence was immediate—and oddly calming. Still, a slight tension hung in the air. No one spoke. Only La Mère’s voice echoed softly through the corridors.

They passed the dining hall, the gardens, and walked through long stone hallways that led to a chapel and a meditation room. The place was beautiful—filled with old, sacred details. Then, La Mère came to a stop.

“This,” she said, “is the sanitary area. You may use it from 7:00 to 7:15 in the morning, and again in the evening from 8:00 to 8:15.”

Noa looked around. A few people instinctively glanced at their watches or phones. It was 9:30 AM. That would be… a challenge. Thankfully, she’d gone to the bathroom before leaving home. But she could see panic creeping onto a few faces.

Elena, a girl who looked barely eighteen, raised her hand—breaking the silence.

“Sorry,” she said. “Why is that? I was in a rush this morning and didn’t plan for this.”

“Ssssst,” La Mère hissed. The sound echoed sharply through the halls.

Footsteps approached from behind. A woman in dark robes who had been walking at the back of the group stepped forward, gently took Elena by the arm, and guided her away. She looked kind, even smiled softly—but Elena’s face betrayed her alarm. She glanced back at the group.

No one said a word. No one dared.

“Okay then,” Noa thinks. “Talking’s definitely a no.”

The tour continues. As they walk, the new nuns are given a rapid-fire overview of the days to come. At 6:30 every morning, they’ll be woken for a silent walk in the garden. After the designated bathroom moment, there’s a cold body wash, morning meditation in the chapel, breakfast, yoga, a work session, lunch, time for personal reflection, a tea ceremony, evening meditation, dinner, ritual cleansing—and at exactly 8:20 PM, the doors to their rooms lock will be locked.

They bring their suitcases to their rooms and hand in the rest of their belongings. Phones, watches, and jewelry go into a large, sealed chest.

The first day goes by without incident, though there’s already a faint discomfort in the air. Some people struggle to settle into the meditations, and the silence makes it hard to feel connected. They follow the schedule wordlessly, and after the first tea ceremony, a sense of unease settles over the group. When the bell rings at dinner—indicating they’re allowed to speak—there’s an immediate burst of conversation.

Most of the talk is about the bathroom rules. Some shift uncomfortably in their chairs, others act like it’s no big deal. Noa stays quiet. Like it or not, this was how things worked now. Thanks to her job as a hostess, she’s used to holding it in. Waiting until 8 PM wasn’t ideal, but not impossible either.

Another topic quickly emerges: the disappearance of Elena. Where did she go? There’s whispering—someone should ask. John volunteers. He raises his hand, and La Mère approaches.

“Where did Elena go, if I may ask? Was it just because she spoke?”

La Mère’s face tightens. She hadn’t expected the question. “Oubliette,” she replies.

The group looks around in confusion.

“She will spend the day reflecting on her mistake in the oubliette,” she adds, before walking away.

They exchange glances. No one really knows what she meant. Most don’t speak French.

“It’s time to finish up and return to your rooms in silence. The toilets will be opened shortly. Please refrain from speaking from this point on,” La Mère says.

By the time Noa arrives at the bathrooms, it’s exactly 8 PM. A line has already formed—fifteen people, all waiting. Most look uncomfortable. Noa isn’t having the easiest time either; she really needs to go. But her thoughts are elsewhere.

She wonders how Elena is doing. It took courage to sign up for something like this at such a young age. Noa sincerely hopes she’s being treated with care.

The door opens, and the first two dart into the bathrooms. It takes about three minutes before both stalls are free again. The next pair go in—this time, they're a bit quicker. Relief is written all over their faces as they step out. Then the doors close again. Another three minutes. And then another.

Noa checks her watch. 8:11. People glance around anxiously. Nine have gone. Six remain. Four minutes left.

The next two hurry. They're done in two minutes. 8:13.

Noa wants to ask the others to move faster—but speaking is no longer allowed.

Another pair slip inside. 8:14. Noa stands next to John, both watching the door intently. She hears the toilet flush.

8:15.

“Please return to your rooms,” says one of the nuns.

The words hit Noa and John like a blow. Noa instinctively opens her mouth to protest, but John gently places a hand over her lips. Talking is forbidden during silence hours.

The nun turns the heavy lock on the door. Noa and John walk toward the dorms. They exchange a glance, a small nod, and go their separate ways. The door clicks shut behind her.

Noa stands in her room, her bladder painfully full. It’s a small space with a narrow, uncomfortable bed, a nightstand holding a candle, and her suitcase. Nothing else. For the first time today, she crosses her legs. The need to go is undeniable now.

She tells herself: Just get in bed. Morning will come faster.

Sleep comes surprisingly quickly, despite it all. The day had been overwhelming. A blur of new impressions.

But the unfamiliar room, and the tension from earlier, weigh on her. Her sleep is restless. She wakes again—her bladder now pressing urgently. What had been bearable before is beginning to feel critical.

She looks around. No clock. The only hint of time is the small window, through which she sees only darkness.

Noa lets out a quiet, helpless laugh. What kind of situation is this? She’s all the way in France, in an old monastery, locked inside a tiny room, her bladder bursting, with no sense of time. Are they going to wake us soon? Or is it still four hours away? She has no idea.

Sleep won’t return easily. Her mind jumps between thoughts of Elena—the poor girl who already needed to go that morning—and her own rising discomfort.

She throws back the blanket and looks down at her belly. She can see the bulge now.

Three hours crawl by as she awkwardly tries to find a comfortable position. She uses the blankets to press something into her vagina in an attempt to relieve the pressure on her bladder.

Then, after lying awake for a long time, she suddenly falls asleep again from sheer exhaustion.

Though it’s just a small window, the first rays of sunlight begin to illuminate the tiny room. The brightness hits Noa’s face, and her eyes open slowly. She’s disoriented.

“Where am I? And why do I need to pee so insanely badly?!” she thinks.

Under the covers, she reaches down and feels her underwear. Damp. Not soaked, but she’s definitely leaked. Not surprising, given the pressure.

She rubs her eyes and notices that the door is slightly ajar. Slowly, she slips out of bed to see what’s going on. Only as she stands does she fully register the state she’s in—she needs to run, now.

“Oh no,” she whispers. “First that stupid silent walk through the garden.”

She peeks into the hallway through the crack in the door. No one in sight. All the other doors are open too. She quickly gets dressed and steps out as quietly and swiftly as possible. No one’s in their rooms.

She walks past the bathrooms and imagines how good it would feel. But they’re still locked.

Wandering the endless hallways of the monastery, she sees no one. She passes the garden—empty.

“Where is everyone? Oh my god, I really need to pee,” she mutters.

As long as no one is watching, she dares—every now and then—to press her hand between her legs, trying to ease the pressure just a little.

Then, as she turns a corner, she finds herself in the dining hall.

Everyone is there. Sitting in complete silence at the breakfast table, staring at her in shock.

A large clock hangs on the wall. It’s 8:45.

Nearly two hours past the morning bathroom window.

The sight of the clock alone causes her to leak again—just from the shock. She stops it immediately, but the pain is sharp and unbearable. She tries not to show anything on her face. Smiling gently, she quietly takes a seat at the table, trying to look composed.

No one knows she didn’t make it to the bathroom last night—except John. He looks at her with unmistakable sympathy.

She has so many questions, but talking is not allowed.

How am I going to hold this until 8 PM? And—where is Elena?

Breakfast is coming to an end.

"Welcome to your first yoga session," says La Mère. "In this combination of breathing exercises and stretches, we find stillness. Make no sound, and connect with God wherever possible."

"Lie on your back. Bend your knees. Close your eyes," her voice echoes gently through the room.

Noa follows as best she can. No one must notice how much she’s struggling.

“Breathe in slowly through your nose. Feel your belly expand. Exhale… softly… through your mouth,” La Mère continues.

Noa lies on her back, on the thin mat that smells of old incense and damp stone. Her thighs clenched, heels tucked under her hips, trying anything to ease the pressure. Everything inside her trembles. Not visibly—but she can feel how close her muscles are to giving up. Her bladder is painfully full. It burns.

“Breathe in,” La Mère’s voice soothes. “Feel your stomach fill. Hold it…”

“Hold your breath,” she continues. “Just as you hold back what is not yet pure. What wants to leave you is not always clean. Let it wait… until it is.”

Noa bites the inside of her cheek.

Then comes child’s pose. La Mère demonstrates on the mat.

Noa starts sweating.

She lowers into position, knees apart, belly sinking toward the floor. Everything in her body screams no. But she obeys. She doesn’t want anyone to see what she’s going through. Even the men—who she’d assumed would be less flexible—move smoothly into the stretch.

As her stomach touches the mat, she feels it—another leak. Warm, immediate.

She jolts upright, quickly pressing her legs together.

“Noa, we are not finished. Please return to the position,” La Mère calls out.

Noa wants to respond, but stops herself just in time. Speaking is not allowed.

Instead, she shakes her head.

La Mère slowly turns toward her. She doesn’t walk—she glides across the floor.

She looks at Noa. Long and unblinking. No trace of sympathy.

“You think no one notices,” she whispers into her ear.

A pause.

“But I feel it. Every muscle in your lower body… fighting.”

Noa’s eyes snap open.

“You think it’s a secret,” says La Mère. “But it is no secret to God.”

Then softer—almost tenderly: “And you do not want to fail in front of God. Back into position.”

Noa’s muscles tighten. She returns to child’s pose. She spreads her knees again and lowers her upper body toward the floor.

Immediately, she feels a sudden spurt into her underwear.

La Mère’s words echo through her mind.

Another spurt.

The orange juice and tea from breakfast now press heavily in her abdomen. She can feel it—undeniably. This is the longest she’s ever gone without using the bathroom. It’s no longer possible to hold it.

She releases. A long burst into her underwear. She tries to stop it—but her body won’t listen. The dam has broken.

She curls in on herself, pressing both hands between her legs. Only when half of it is out can she finally stop the flow.

It is unbearable. Humiliating.

La Mère watches her with cold disapproval. This time, she is the one who shakes her head.

The entire group stares, shocked, as they see the puddle forming beneath Noa’s mat.

From the back of the room, a nun approaches. She takes Noa gently by the arm and leads her out.

“Oubliette,” La Mère calls after them.
