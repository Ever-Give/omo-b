I’m looking for the story called Summer Job. Was by someone named Bob Smiley. It used to be on here, and other sites including Shers and Gers but now I can’t find it anywhere.

It was about a woman who gets a job to dress up as a bear for some children’s parade and she keeps having accidents so they have her wear diapers to keep the suit clean. Also has another woman who makes her have some of the accidents.

Any help is appreciated thank you!!

Yes this looks like the one!! I’ll have to do some work in taking out all the weird characters they put in for apostrophes! It’s also hard to find the other parts

But none the less, thank you!!

There is actually an archive of all the stories posted on Shara and Ger's on here.

Story isn’t on there. Probably was removed from the site before the archive was taken

I did find a story on there called "Summer Job", though it was by Aquarius, not Bob Smiley(I used the Wayback Machine to check the site and didn't see any author with that name on there). Perhaps Bob plagiarized the story from Aquarius and that's why it got removed from the site?

Good investigating! But unfortunately it’s not the same story!

The link was posted above! Just wish I could find it all in tact on one page
