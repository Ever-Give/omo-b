The Misfortune Of One Mikayla McAllister

Holy shit, Christ almighty this cannot be happening…

My thoughts began to consume me as I sat in the uber-hard plastic desk chair I was offered to seat myself in during a rather mundane substitute teaching job interview. It was 5:30 PM, which should come as no surprise to myself, someone who’s aware of the busy schedule of full time educators, especially those who teach in a K-12 learning establishment.

I was rather uncomfortable in this particular setting, because I happened to be being interviewed for a month long substitution for a 8th grade English teacher, something that put me out of my element (not teaching wise, of course) but because I was not used to being unable to dismiss myself right across the room to the girls room. I had taught only 1st through 7th at this point in my district, all of which had access to a single restroom in each classroom, only feet away when nature called, and I had become all to comfortable with this luxury. But now here I was, my education proving to be detrimental not to my brain or my wallet, but to my feeble bladder.

I was sat only a foot across from my interviewer, Mrs.Meeks, a go-getter brunette of maybe five-foot-one tops, aged twenty-eight with hair to rival Rapunzel, a slim physique unmatched by anyone who could ever be in her position, who eyed me intently wondering why someone two years her senior would be nervously squirming sat in a students chair in front of her desk. She was smiling. I was smiling. She was shuffling meaningless papers in front of her. I was shuffling my legs in a monkey-see fashion, so similarly to her paper ruffling that it might not seem that I was only trying desperately to not shoot a jet of hot, warm, piss into my new Victoria Secret panties, that felt so naughty this morning when I slipped them on before my tasteful Kaki shorts, only to have them be a result of possible embarrassment and a risk of total soiling…

”So…Mrs…”

“Miss!” , I chime in, meaninglessly.

”So…MISS…Mclistur…”

I don’t correct her.

”You’ve taught…sorry, you’ve covered for teachers grades…hmm…”

She shuffled through papers meaninglessly

”So…you haven’t covered any…high school classes. You think you’re up to this?”

“Of course!”, I say, albeit way too enthusiastically, “I know everything there is to know about this years curriculum, I’ve studied-“

”No, no…”, Mrs.Meeks condescendingly smirks, “that’s not the point sweetheart.”

It’s at this point the pressure on my bladder really coincides with my heart-pounding levels of anxiety. She stares at me with such unwarranted vitriol that I become uncharacteristically intimidated, which puts a fight-or-flight level of pressure on my bladder, letting a quick spurt of a long held piss spray through my panties onto the cheap plastic of the chair that holds my smaller frame, making a slight hiss noise before settling into the light-sand tone of my shorts, darkening the once pristine fabric.

“I mean you haven’t been experienced in handling adolescents…”

”No, but…” I rebut,

“So then, how do I know you can handle…are you okay, Miss McAllister?”

My eyes are watering. I’m squirming hopelessly both with anxiety and a desperate need to spray a long held piss into a toilet, hell a pan, fuck, a cup would do.

“I’m-fine Mrs…I just-uh-“

Another spurt of hot piss sprays into my panties, this time making a much more audible hiss that I need to catch with a hand to the crotch, trying desperately to keep a flood of long-held urine behind not only the fabric of my ONLY lingerie, but my future employers’ office floor.

“Look, Mikalee, is it?”

Fuck. She’s going first name basis, in all the wrong ways.

”You’ve got all the qualifications…on paper. But I’m not feeling that you’re quite the right…WHAT THE FUCK!?

As soon as she began her sentence my bladder had given up, I started to spray a very audible strong stream of piss straight out of my panties, completely bypassing the insulation of my shorts, not only soaking the sandy color of them into a dark brown but spraying them a glass-like shine, forming a puddle onto the linoleum tile spread so far only a tsunami could rival, ruining my underdressed black converse and barely touching my superiors no-doubt thousand dollar heels.

“I-I’m so…”, I say pathetically.

”You’ve…” Mrs. Meeks exclaims in a rage, half quietly, half stunned, “You’ve…WET-PISSED-YOU PEED-WHY DIDN’T YOU ASK TO USE THE REST-WHAT THE FUCK…!?

”Listen I…”

It’s no use. I sit up, dripping as I walk out of the small office, all the while I’m feeling an unmatched sense of self loathing.

I commence an unrivaled walk-of-shame through the district parking lot, and sit in my car contemplating. “Fuck it.”, I say aloud. I feel a long-held pressure in my lower abdomen. “I’ve humiliated myself enough for one day.”, I say to myself. “Why not be in control of it?”

I put my car into gear and begin to drive. I let the pressure built up inside until it reaches a low enough point to compete with my soaked panties.

Im at a red light…I look to my left and see none other than Mrs. Meeks beside me, of course she’s driving a convertible BMW…I roll down my window…

”HEY BITCH!”

She looks at me in disgust upon recognition. But she doesn’t need to know what I’m doing…just the thrill of it is emo hit for me.

”FUCK YOUUUUU!”

I begin to let out a huge solid load into my panties, absolutely filling them and overloading into my shorts, leaving a huge stench that only briefly passed my nostrils before escaping my rolled down window.

I accepted my triumph, and went home and discarded my sexy panties and pants.

I lay down on my bed and adjust my pillows to see my television screen.

A news broadcast is on.

“Students lacking adequate restroom breaks in exams, more about this at 10PM!”

”Well shit…” I say.

“Too little….too late.
