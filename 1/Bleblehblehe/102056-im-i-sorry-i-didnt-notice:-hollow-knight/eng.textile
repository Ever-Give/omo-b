It had been an uneventful day at the white palace. Not many civilians would go to see the Pale King, the White Lady had been in her gardens, and ‘Hollow’ had been doing as he was told like always.

How boring.

Pale King had flopped his head down in his desk, dreading all the paperwork, trying to find the cure to the radiance, everything was exhausting. But it’s not like he can blame anyone, he’s the one that was being lazy for whatever reason today. How was it that even after pouring hours of his existence into finding a cure to the radiance, he could never find a pin-point cure? All his options depended on a coin flip. And even those options were cruel.

His heart still wrenched for those children that he left to die in a ditch…

The only one he had left was Hollow, as he called it. And even though he tried to not feel parental to the vessel, he just… couldn’t help it… Every time he saw those empty eye sockets, he felt a strong feeling to protect them at all costs. But he just had to try his best to hide it.

After a few hours of pondering, and scribbling away on his many papers, it was eventually time to eat dinner. He usually doesn’t eat much during work, but he was willing to do anything to get out of it at this point. He sat down at the dinner table, staring at where his wife The White Lady would be sitting. He still wondered when she would return from her gardens… as for Hollow, they were peacefully eating soup and drinking water. Pale King wondered how he was e en able to do that if he didn’t have a mouth, but oh well what does it matter?

Pale King and Hollow continued to enjoy their soup, and Hollow was downing tea like it was the end of the world. Pale King cringed at the idea of going back to being locked in his prison of paperwork. But he couldn’t hold it off til tomorrow, his work would pile up that way. But he would need some kind of entertainment to bring himself enough energy to get through another night of endless work. At first he had no idea what he could do, he could bring one of his servants, but they were heading home for the day… He could play music, but he didn’t have any music players.

But then he realized, he had Hollow sitting right next to him! He could bring him along and let the vessel roam free through his office. It’s a questionable way of entertainment, but what else does he have. He’s willing to take anything. Besides, Hollow would have fun searching around his office. Not like Hollow needed to have fun, but Pale Kings bored, so why not?

“Hollow, come with me to my office.”Pale King said as he gestured for Hollow to follow him. Hollow put his empty cup of tea down, and followed the pale figure. The duo walked down the near-empty hallway. Pale King was sharing some stories of his time as a Wrym to Hollow, how he would traverse through tunnels, hunt for food, it was surprising to hear how someone so animalistic would turn into someone so sophisticated. Hollow listened closely, they were so mesmerized by the stories of their father, it was like a lullaby to them. They wondered if they didn’t have to contain the radiance, they would be able to forge a kingdom of their own and be just like their father.

Unfortunately, that can’t come true.

The two had reached the door of Pale Kings office, the swirly silver markings in it were a nice touch. Inside his office were tons of white and gray machinery, all used for different things. Machines for training gauntlets, for defense systems, even for personal convenience. “And this is the office, I’m gonna write some rules on the board ok?” Pale King said as he started writing in the board with chalk.

OFFICE RULES.

- Don’t touch anything without asking.

- Don’t be too loud.

- Don’t be reckless.

- Don’t be bothersome.

Hollow carefully read the words on the board, making sure to listen to everything their father said. It was great to be invited into his office, they didn’t want to make him think that he can’t bring them here anymore. “Sit down here, there’s something I wanna show you.” Pale king said as he brought out a cushion on the floor for Hollow to sit on. Pale King went to search in his cupboard for something, eventually he brought out a box that had ‘MUSIC BOX’ written on the front. He plopped the box down in front of Hollow, and kneeled on the floor in front of them and started to empty out the box.

Hollow stared with curiosity at his father emptying out that strange box. Inside was small gears, cranks, screws, and all kinds of things like that. But what fascinated Hollow the most was a strange comb-like object that sounded like a twinkling light. They brushed their stub hand against it, intrigued by the sound. “You like it?” Pale King suddenly asked him. Hollow nodded and continued brushing his hand against it. “You know it can make an even better sound, let me show you.” Pale King grabbed the comb from Hollows hand, and placed it in a box filled with that confusing contraction, of gears and screws. He placed in a strange, bumpy, cylinder next to it and started turning a small crank.

At first Hollow could only hear whirring, then all of a sudden, a beautiful sound started to play. Hollow could feel tingles all around their body, the sound was the most beautiful sound they ever heard. “It’s calming right? You wanna build another one?” Pale king said as he handed Hollow a small wooden box, screws, gears, the comb-like object, and a small crank. Pale King also laid out the same objects in front of him. “Watch carefully on how I do it ok?” He said as he got to work on building the musical box of joy. He managed to finish the box in about 20 minutes and the box was now playing another happy tune. “I’m gonna get started on work, behave.” Pale King said as he got up from the floor, and sat at his desk.

Finally… this whole ‘parenting thing’ was exhausting… Now he just hoped the music box would keep Hollow entertained long enough for them to fall asleep. It was hard enough to talk with one person… It was a whole new dimension of hard talking to Hollow. He was so focused on trying to repress his guilt with the abyss, he tried to push Hollow away. But still… He felt love and care to that poor vessel…

As for Hollow, they were peacefully tinkering around with the music box. They really liked it, maybe they could sneak it into their room? No… Father would get mad if they did… Besides, they can’t get attached, they shouldn’t be capable of getting attached to anything. But they just couldn’t… help it…. They continued building their music box for about 20 minutes, it’s a lot harder than it looks… when out of nowhere, they got a weird feeling in their lower abdomen…

They squirmed a bit, why did they drink all that tea..? Their bladder was sloshing about as they tried to keep working on their music box, they could hold it til father sent them back to their room… right? They can’t just say they had to pee, they didn’t have a voice, and it would be considered as bothering him, breaking one of his rules. Just don’t think about it… Hollow wasn’t even allowed to think anyways. So they kept their legs squeezed together, trying to distract themself with the music box.

An hour had had passed, and Hollow’s situation had only gotten worse. They couldn’t focus on anything but their need, and there was no way father was gonna send them back to their room anytime soon. He probably forgot they was there to begin with… The Pale King had been scribbling away on his paperwork for the past hour, and it was like he was in his own little world of work. Hollow rubbed their legs together, the sound of rustling snapped the Pale King out of his trance.

Pale King turned around to see the squirming vessel, that immediately stopped when they noticed him looking at them. “Stop moving around, I’m trying to focus.” Pale King honestly felt bad for sounding so rude. But what other option did he have? Hollow had tried their best to stop moving around, their bladder screamed in protest… Hollow started shivering, clutching their cloak. How much longer til father would send them back to their room? They couldn’t wait much longer…

It had been 3 long hours since Hollow had felt the need to go, now they were at their limit. They couldn’t sit still… the pressure in their bladder was excruciating… “Hollow?” The sudden voice of the Pale King startled them so much they leaked. Luckily nothing showed yet, but they didn’t want to wait to see how long it would take for that to happen… The Pale King was confused, he got up from his desk, and bent down facing Hollow. “Is something bothering you..?” He asked, slightly stroking Hollow’s horns. Hollow was about to nod their head, but just when they did, a sharp pang hit their bladder making them freeze up. It was really bad…

“Hollow I can’t help if you don’t tell me what’s wrong. Is something bothering you, yes, or no?” Pale King asked a bit more firmly, but all Hollow could do was shiver and bounce in place. Pale king took note of his behavior, were they sick? Were they tired? Were they scared? Maybe… Pale king was snapped out of his thoughts when he heard a hissing noise in front of him. Hollow gripped their crotch in a sad attempt to hold their pee, but to no avail. All they could do was shiver in fear at what was happening.

Before the Pale King could have any time to register what was happening to Hollow, pee started dripping from the cushion Hollow was sitting on. Pale King stepped back in surprise as the puddle continued to spread. Was Hollow really wetting themself? They weren’t a hatchling anymore, why would they be..? The steam went on for a long minute, and finally all that could be heard was dripping from the cushion. Pale King and Hollow stared at each other for what felt like an eternity, what were they supposed to do in that kind of situation? Pale King was about to start ranting about how Hollow was old enough to not be having accidents, and that he expected better from them, but when he saw tears well up in the vessels eyes sockets… It was like a switch of parental instincts had flipped on.

Pale king gently picked up the crying vessel, having their head hand over his shoulder, and started walking over to the bathroom. Pale King rubbed comforting circles into Hollows back, shushing their cries and muttering sweet nothings did little to nothing to stop the little ones rivers of void coming from their eye sockets. Eventually after what felt like forever, the duo were in the bathroom and Pale King sat Hollow down next to the hot spring. The vessel was still crying their eyes out, shivering from the chill their wet clothes gave them, and it was breaking Pale Kings heart. “Hollow…” He said as he bent over, the vessel looking up at his face. “Let’s get you cleaned up.”

Pale King started to gently remove the soiled cloak from Hollow body, they were grateful to finally have that uncomfortable thing off of them. He lead Hollow over to the hot spring and let the vessel enjoy the warmth of the water. But even with the comfort, he could tell Hollow was still uncomfortable about what happened in his office. I mean, who wouldn’t be?

“Hollow… I’m sorry I didn’t notice what you needed earlier. If I noticed sooner I could’ve taken you to the bathroom and your accident would’ve been avoided…” Pale King said with clear guilt in his voice, heck, he was probably the reason Hollow didn’t tell him anything to begin with! He felt terrible. Communicating with Hollow was a bit complicated because they didn’t have a voice, but Pale King did understand sign language. Hollow motioned ‘No, I’m sorry for bothering you’ Pale King responded with “Bothering me? Telling somebody what you need isn’t bothering! Not telling how accidents happen, THEN people are bothered, but never because you’re just asking for a basic bodily function…” Pale King said while throwing some water on Hollows shoulder. “You can bathe here, I’ll be in your room when you’re done.”

Pale King walked to his office, now this would be the tricky part… he managed to clean up the puddle with some cleaning supplies he had in his closet. It would be a strange sight for anyone else, seeing the King of Hallownest cleaning up his child’s little mess. But it was also normal at the same time… How strange… He also grabbed the music box Hollow had built. He was honestly surprised they managed to build such a good music box while they were bursting to pee, probably a high pain tolerance or something… But the sound of the happy tune might help calm the vessel down.

When he got to Hollows room, he got a change of clothes ready for them, and put a protective cover over their mattress. They might have to go in the middle of the night, and a mattress would be a pain to clean… Pale King went back to the bathroom to give Hollow their change of clothes, and to carry them back to their room. Pale King sat at the edge of Hollows bed, their head was rested on his lap with a soft blanket over their body. Pale King winded the music box, and the happy tune was played, making Hollow to start drifting off to sleep. Pale King gently stroked the side of Hollows head, everything in the moment was so… comforting…

“I hope this is a lesson learned to you Hollow. Make sure you tell me next time you need the bathroom ok?” He whispered, Hollow nodded. They had such a long, exhausting day. “Go to sleep Hollow… it’s late…” Pale King said, as he hummed along to the song of the music box. So Hollow did as he said, and went unconscious. They really needed some sleep.

I was in the mood for hollow knight omo considering there’s barely any in the community. Ur welcome.😌👍
