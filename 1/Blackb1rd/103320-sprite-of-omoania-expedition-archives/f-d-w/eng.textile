Hello! You may recognize me from over in the Interactive Story forum, where I run the Sprite of Omoania saga. I've had a few people express some interest in getting an easy to downloaded format of the stories I've written on here and that's far easier to do on my end than theirs. I actually intended to do something like this for the beginning by trimming the interactive down into a standalone story. But in the end, I decided that I was better off just getting on with writing the next part instead.

If you're reading my stuff for the first time, please understand that the document attached below this and subsequent posts in this topic is a compilation of the different turns and voting cycles on the main interactive. While the primary story is feature complete, there are a number of side characters or setups that are not explored or fleshed out simply because the votes went a different way. The exact content varies expedition to expedition, though I generally write a lot of pee desperation, have sexually explicit content such as masturbation in future expeditions, often feature "furry" characters ranging from a simple ears and tail to fully anthro, write occasional diaper use, but absolutely no messing or ABDL in any of the stories. Any violence is pretty laid back and not gory or too serious, this is a DnD-like fantasy world with a health injection of porn logic to make situations always work out in the end. ðŸ˜‰

If you're coming in from already following the original interactive, nothing here is fundamentally different from what's already been posted. I've trimmed out the author's notes and all but the final vote tallies, but the story plays out the same apart from another editing pass on my end. In short, I hope this is just an easier way to reread the story without navigating through pages upon pages of responses.

The other reason to make this topic is that I also want it serve as an informal wiki to the interactive. It goes without saying that I'm one of the top contender for needlessly complex plots for the sake of simple pee porn, so getting things properly organized helps if people need to catch up on a prior chapter or character. For example, I've noted which notable characters are encountered in each expedition, both for the first time and if we'd previously seen them before. I'm not sure how frequently I'll update this thread, but the re-editing process should get quicker and quicker each time.

Let me know if there's any issue with the .pdf file. If you like what you see, feel free to swing by the original interactive where I'm currently gearing up for Expedition #10 later this week. I always love to hear from new voters. Enjoy!
